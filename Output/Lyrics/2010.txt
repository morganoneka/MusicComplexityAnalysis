sometimes i can’t believe i’m moving past feeling
sometimes i can’t believe i’m moving past feeling
and night
so understand i want daughter
while i’m still young i wanna hold hand show beauty
before damage done it’s much ask
if it’s much ask send son
under overpass parking lot we’re still waiting
it’s already passed move feet hot pavement
and grass 'cause it’s already past it’s already already past
sometimes i can’t believe i’m moving past feeling
sometimes i can’t believe i’m moving past feeling

in dreams
we're still screaming

and wonders hears sounds
frantically searching dreams

why things im feeling
theres much time
for speak i keep quiet
ill complicate mantra
the power's i cant turn fan
so i call tonight
im trying make mind
just i feel
could tell whats real
i hear voice phone
now im longer alone
just i feel
could tell whats real anymore
voice low
sneaking around goes
i always try best listen
picking things i fidget
circle speed
pacing around watching feet
batteries drain i memo
i think i might let go
so i call tonight
im trying make mind
just i feel
could tell whats real
i hear voice phone
now im longer alone
just i feel
could tell whats real anymore

so i call tonight
im trying make mind
just i feel
could tell whats real
i hear voice phone
now im longer alone
just i feel
could tell whats real anymore
i look ground see sad teary eyes
you look away i see something trying hide
and i reach hand cold pull away
and i wonder mind
and say made dumb mistake
you start tremble voice begins break
you say cigarettes counter friend’s they mate’s
and i feel colour draining face
"i know love mate
it matter put phone away
it's never easy walk away
let go oh oh oh
so i asked look back messages sent
and i know right fucking head
and everything deleted past yea gone
and i touched face i tell moving
but fact kissed yesterday
it's feeling betrayal i seem shake
and everything i know tells i walk away
but i want stay
"i know love mate
it matter put phone away
it's never easy walk away
let go oh oh oh
it's gonna hurt bit time
so bottoms forget tonight
you'll find another fine
let go oh oh oh
but nothing heals
past time
and steal
the love born find
but nothing heals
past time
and steal
the love born find
"i know love mate
it matter put phone away
it's never easy walk away
let go oh oh oh
it's gonna hurt bit time
so bottoms forget tonight
you'll find another fine
let go oh oh oh"
it’ll alright
it’ll alright
it’ll alright
it’ll alright

there swelling storm
and i'm caught middle
and takes control person i thought i
the boy i used know
there light dark
and i feel warmth
in hands heart
why i hold
it comes goes waves
it always always
we watch young hearts fade
into flood flood
freedom falling
the feeling i thought set stone
slips fingers
trying hard let go
it comes goes waves
it comes goes waves
it carries us away
through wind
down place used lay kids
memories stolen place
caught silence echo lost space
it comes goes waves
it always always
we watch young hearts fade
into flood flood
freedom falling
the feeling i thought set stone
slips fingers
trying hard let go
it comes goes waves
it comes goes waves
it carries us away
i watched wild youth disappear front eyes
moments magic wonder
seems hard find
is coming back
is coming back
take back feeling
everything left find
it comes goes waves
it always always
freedom falling
the feeling i thought set stone
slips fingers
trying hard let go
it comes goes waves
it comes goes waves

ich wart seit wochen auf diesen tag
und tanz vor freude über den asphalt
als wär's ein rythmus als gäb's ein lied
das mich immer weiter durch die straßen zieht
komm dir entgegen dich abzuholen wie ausgemacht
zu der selben uhrzeit selben treffpunkt wie letztes mal
durch das gedränge der menschenmenge
bahnen wir uns den altbekannten weg
entlang der gassen zu den rheinterrassen
über die brücken bis hin zu der musik
wo alles laut ist wo alle drauf sind um durchzudreh'n
wo die anderen warten um mit uns zu starten und abzugeh'n
an tagen wie diesen wünscht man sich unendlichkeit
an tagen wie diesen haben wir noch ewig zeit
wünsch ich mir unendlichkeit
das hier ist ewig ewig für heute
wir steh'n nicht still für eine ganze nacht
komm ich trag dich durch die leute
hab keine angst ich gebe auf dich acht
wir lassen uns treiben tauchen unter schwimmen mit dem strom
dreh'n unsere kreise kommen nicht mehr runter sind schwerelos
an tagen wie diesen wünscht man sich unendlichkeit
an tagen wie diesen haben wir noch ewig zeit
in dieser nacht der nächte die uns viel verspricht
erleben wir das beste kein ende ist sicht
kein ende sicht
kein ende sicht
kein ende sicht fadebase pond
an tagen wie diesen wünscht man sich unendlichkeit
an tagen wie diesen haben wir noch ewig zeit
in dieser nacht der nächte die uns viel verspricht
erleben wir das beste kein ende ist sicht
erleben wir das beste und kein ende sicht
kein ende sicht

hello darkness old friend
i've come talk
because vision softly creeping
left seeds i sleeping
and vision planted brain
still remains within sound silence
in restless dreams i walked alone
narrow streets cobblestone
'neath halo street lamp
i turned collar cold damp
when eyes stabbed flash neon light
that split night
and touched sound silence
and naked light i saw
ten thousand people maybe
people talking without speaking
people hearing without listening
people writing songs voices never share
and one dare
disturb sound silence
fools said i know
silence cancer grows
hear words i might teach
take arms i might reach
but words silent raindrops fell
and echoed wells silence
and people bowed prayed
to neon god made
and sign flashed warning
and words forming
the words prophets written subway walls
and tenement halls
and whispered sound silence
am i allowed look
could wrong nice look
and smells lemongrass sleep
she tastes apple juice peach
you find polaroid picture
and means everything
i'd never tell
no i'd never say word
and oh aches
but feels oddly good hurt
and smells lemongrass sleep
she tastes apple juice peach
you find polaroid picture
and means everything
i'll okay
admiring afar
cause even next
we far apart
cause tastes birthday cake storytime fall
but
i taste nothing
and smells lemongrass sleep
she tastes apple juice peach
you find polaroid picture
and means everything
yes means everything
she means everything

where'd time go
it's starting fly
see hands go
waving goodbye
and know i forgetful
i look eyes
now walking backwards
parade
and i'm stuck shadow
blocking shade
and ain't way sweep
mess made
she gets dressed pillow
always bed
flowers sick dead
she's go way fast way slow
she'll turn stone hospitals funeral homes
fog rises somebody sighs
disguise anymore
there's nothing keep
falling love
it starts bottom
comes
like pieces puzzle hand glove
she gets dressed pillow always bed
flowers sick dead
she's go way fast way slow
she'll turn stop hospitals funeral homes
tide rises somebody sinks gone blink eye

ya dime si quieres estar conmigo o si mejor voy
tus besos dicen que tu si quieres pero tus palabras
y al chile yo hasta moriría por ti pero dices que
no eres directa neta ya estás cansando sé concreta por favor
y en la noche que las estrellas salen yo pienso en ti mi amor
que hiciste de mi cabeza sales
y lo digo por mamon
si dices para ti qué soy dudaré en hacerte tan feliz
eres especial para mi
dime por qué haces sufrir
yo te olvidaré desde las fuentes de ortiz
soy inseguro cuando dices que quieres porque creo que
como bebé caigo pero sí redondito en tu trampa amor
ya dime si tu quieres por favor
y sufrido y empedado tanto por tu amor
y en la noche en que las estrellas salen
yo pienso en ti mi amor
qué hiciste de mi cabeza sales
y lo digo por mamon
si dices para ti quién soy
no durare en hacerte tan feliz eres especial para mi
dime por qué haces sufrir
yo te olvidaré desde las fuentes de ortiz

i loved hair
and moment i knew beth
white lips pale face
breathing snowflakes
burnt lungs sour taste
light's gone day's end
struggling pay rent
long nights strange men
and say
she's class a team
stuck daydream
been way
but lately face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling pastries
the worst things life come free us
cos upperhand
and go mad couple grams
and want go outside tonight
and pipe flies motherland
or sells love another man
it's cold outside
for angels fly
angels fly
ripped gloves raincoat
tried swim stay afloat
dry house wet clothes
loose change bank notes
wearyeyed dry throat
call girl phone
and say
she's class a team
stuck daydream
been way
but lately face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling pastries
the worst things life come free us
cos upperhand
and go mad couple grams
and want go outside tonight
and pipe flies motherland
or sells love another man
it's cold outside
for angels fly
an angel will die
covered white
and hoping better life
this time fade tonight
straight line
and say
she's class a team
stuck daydream
been way
but lately face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling pastries
the worst things life come free us
cos upperhand
and go mad couple grams
and want go outside tonight
and pipe fly motherland
or sell love another man
it's cold outside
for angels fly
angels fly
to fly fly
angels fly fly fly
angels die

hulinaa kadut täynnä valoja vaan
valoja väreissä taivaan ja maan
joku piiloutuu lahjavuorten taa
joku kadulle pulloja soittelemaan
juoskoon tää kansa sen kiireensä kii
jota varten tänne muka synnyttiin
mulla ei oo kiire minnekään
aion sulle kynttilän nyt sytyttää
valkoinen maa lunta sataa
tässä mä seison takki auki taas
tämä vuosi joitain suosi enemmän
valkoinen maa antaa sataa
tahtoisin päästä sua halaamaan
tänä vuonna tämän joulun kanssas jaan
kuinka tää kaikki joskus häviää
ja se rikkaus joka kuuluu elämään
sitä silmillä pysty mä en näkemään
särkyköön suruni hetkeksi pois
eikä viha mun sisällä vaikeroi
tahdon vain hetkisen hengähtää
aion sulle kynttilän nyt sytyttää
valkoinen maa lunta sataa
tässä mä seison takki auki taas
tämä vuosi joitain suosi enemmän
valkoinen maa antaa sataa
tahtoisin päästä sua halaamaan
tänä vuonna tämän joulun kanssas jaan
tuol nimettyjen kivien maa
vielä hetken kanssas olla saan
kerran tänne tullaan kerran
täältä lähdetään
kerran tänne tullaan kerran
täältä lähdetään
valkoinen maa lunta sataa
tässä mä seison takki auki taas
tämä vuosi joitain suosi enemmän
valkoinen maa antaa sataa
tahtoisin päästä sua halaamaan
tänä vuonna tämän joulun kanssas jaan
valkoinen maa lunta sataa
tässä mä seison takki auki taas
tämä vuosi joitain suosi enemmän
valkoinen maa antaa sataa
tahtoisin päästä sua halaamaan
tänä vuonna tämän joulun kanssas jaan

instrumental of "verse"
leashless confusion i'll wander concrete
wonder better now survived
jarring judgement reasons defeat
the sweet heat breath mouth i'm alive
with sweetened breath tongue mean

my lover's got humour
she's giggle funeral
knows everybody's disapproval
i should've worshipped sooner
if heavens speak
she last true mouthpiece
every sunday's getting bleak
a fresh poison week
'we born sick' heard say
my church offers absolutes
she tells 'worship bedroom'
the heaven i'll sent
is i'm alone
i born sick i love
command well
aaaaaaaaaaamen amen amen
take church i'll worship dog shrine lies
i'll tell sins sharpen knife
offer deathless death
good god let give life
if i'm pagan good times
my lover's sunlight
to keep goddess side
she demands sacrifice
to drain whole sea
get something shiny
something meaty main course
that's fine looking high horse
what got stable
we've lot starving faithful
that looks tasty
that looks plenty
this hungry work
take church i'll worship dog shrine lies
i'll tell sins sharpen knife
offer deathless death
good god let give life
no masters kings ritual begins
there sweeter innocence gentle sin
in madness soil sad earthly scene
only i human i clean
aaaaaaaaaaamen amen amen
take church i'll worship dog shrine lies
i'll tell sins sharpen knife
offer deathless death
good god let give life
take church i'll worship dog shrine lies

and line distance grows faint
so wide river horizon sliver
the artist run paint
where blue sea meets sky
and big yellow sun leads home

to wind breath

that wars never start
and time heal hearts
and everyone friend
and right always win
and love never end
this grown christmas list
as children believed
the grandest sight see
was something lovely
wrapped beneath tree
but heaven knows
that packages bows
can never heal
a hurting human soul
no lives torn apart
that wars never start
and time heal hearts
and everyone friend
and right always win
and love never end
this grown christmas list
what illusion called
the innocence youth
maybe blind belief
can find truth
no lives torn apart
that wars never start
and time heal hearts
and everyone friend
and right always win
and love never end
this grown christmas list
this grown christmas list
my grown christmas list

sigo cruzando rios andando selvas amando el sol
cada dia sigo sacando espinas de lo profundo del corazon
en la noche sigo encendiendo sueños para limpiar
con el humo sagrado cada recuerdo
cuando escribo tu nombre en la arena blanca con fondo azul
cuando miro al cielo en la forma cruel de una nube gris aparezcas tu
una tarde suba una alta loma mire el pasado
sabras que te olvidado
yo te llevo dentro hasta la raiz
y por mas que crezca vas estar aqui
aunque yo oculte tras las montañas
y encuentre un campo lleno de caña
habra manera ni rayo de luna que tu te vayas
ooooooh
pienso que cada instante sobreviviendo al caminar
y cada segundo de insertidumbre cada momento de saber
son las claves exactas de este tejido que ando cargando
bajo la piel asi te protejo aqui sigues dentro
yo te llevo dentro hasta la raiz
y por mas que crezca vas estar aqui
aunque yo oculte tras las montañas
y encuentre un campo lleno de caña
habra manera ni rayo de luna que tu te vayas
ooooooh
yo te llevo dentro hasta la raiz
y por mas que crezca vas estar aqui
aunque yo oculte tras las montañas
y encuentre un campo lleno de caña
habra manera ni rayo de luna que tu te vayas
esta historia termino existe
lo que un día construimos se ha esfumado
pareciera que es más fácil dejarnos
pero eres un fantasma conmigo caminando
no creas que valió la pena
no creas que eres importante
al contrario yo te ame con toda el alma
no creas que valió la pena
no creas que lo perdimos
ésto que nos duele aunque nos duele es sólo nuestro
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
fue sólo nuestro
fue sólo nuestro
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
se lo lleva el viento
se lo lleva el viento
esta historia termino existe
lo que un día construimos se ha esfumado
pareciera que es más fácil dejarnos
pero eres un fantasma conmigo caminando
yo aprendí soltar amores
yo aprendí dejarte ir
eras una apuesta de largo plazo
lo que construimos
lo que construimos
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
fue sólo nuestro
fue sólo nuestro
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
se lo lleva el viento
se lo lleva el viento
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
fue sólo nuestro
fue sólo nuestro
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
se lo lleva el viento
se lo lleva el viento

je te laisserai des mots
endessous de ta porte
endessous de la lune qui chante
tout près de la place ou tes pieds passent
cachés dans les trous du temps d'hiver
et quand tu es seule pendant un instant
embrassemoi
quand tu voudras
embrassemoi
quand tu voudras
embrassemoi

the handlebars etched body back porch
my brain fucking somewhere roof flags torched
and i stayed chain smoking kitchen got home
and curtains fire fuck i'm sorry feel alone
with tv blasting shadows face
hitching back apartment lonely place

made life
every sky kind blue
and i wanted know feel
and made real
you showed something i see
you opened eyes made believe
you lift feet ground
you spin around
you make crazier crazier
feels i'm falling i
i'm lost eyes
you make crazier crazier crazier
baby showed living
i want hide anymore
you lift feet ground
you spin around
you make crazier crazier
feels i'm falling i
i'm lost eyes
you make crazier crazier crazier
crazier crazier
my love cruel cities i lived
everyone looked worse light
there many lines i've crossed unforgiven
i'll tell truth never goodbye
i wanna look anything now i saw
i wanna think anything now i thought
i've sleeping long dark night
and now i see daylight i see daylight
the luck draw draws unlucky
and i became butt joke
i wounded good i trusted wicked
clearing air i breathed smoke
maybe ran wolves refused settle
maybe i've stormed every single room town
threw cloaks daggers morning now
it's brighter now now
i wanna look anything now i saw
i wanna think anything now i thought
i've sleeping long dark night
and now i see daylight daylight i see daylight daylight
i see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i see daylight daylight daylight daylight
and i still see mind
all intertwined
i believed love black white golden golden
and i still see head
back forth new york sneaking bed
i believed love burning red golden
like daylight daylight
like daylight daylight
i wanna look anything now i saw
and i wanna think anything now i thought
i've sleeping long dark night
and now i see daylight i see daylight i see daylight ahah ahah
i see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i see daylight daylight daylight daylight ah ahah ahahh
i see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i see daylight daylight daylight daylight ah ahah ahahh
like daylight golden daylight
you gotta step daylight let go
just let go let go
i wanna defined things i love
not things i hate
not things i'm afraid i'm afraid
not things haunt middle night
i i think
you love
long nights days revolved around
counting footsteps praying floor fall
and mother accused losing mind
but i swore i fine
you paint blue sky go back turn rain
and i lived chess game
but changed rules everyday
wondering version i might phone
well i stopped picking song let know
dear john i see now gone
don't think i young messed
the girl dress cried whole way home
i should've known
well maybe blind optimism blame
or maybe sick need give love take away
and add name long list traitors understand
and i'll look back regret i ignored said
run fast
dear john i see now gone
don't think i young messed
the girl dress cried whole way home
dear john i see now wrong
don't think young played
your dark twisted games i loved
i should've known
you expert sorry
and keeping lines blurry
never impressed acing tests
all girls run dry
have tired lifeless eyes
cause burned
but i took matches fire catch
so look now
i'm shining fireworks
over sad empty town
dear john i see now gone
don't think i young messed
the girl dress cried whole way home
i see now gone
don't think i young messed
the girl dress wrote song
you should've known
you should've known
don't think i young
you should've known

used love mystery
but now exhausting
another day spent laying room
the stench incense
and undelivered food
and thought

and i'll forced rot away
with obsessions
with trivial things
like amount fucking love hearts i finish text message with"
and hold hands
it feel flying
and take breath away
he might well dying
and dying breathe
you're trapped cage
and shrinking
and thought
"what never leaves
or message
and hear pleas"
so started screaming
"why bore death"
"why bore death"
"oh bore death"
"why bore death"
"oh bore death"
"why bore death"
"oh why bore death"

and go 'round 'n 'round
and i love i leave
i want i need
you know calls back baby
oh i wanna see
but i'm stuck colder weather
maybe tomorrow will better
can i call
cuz i'm ramblin' man
i ain't gonna change
i gotta gypsy soul blame
and i born leavin'
born leavin'
i smell perfume whispering pines
i'm ghost
it's shame weather
i know soon together
and i wait till
i wait till
gonna put world away minute
pretend i live
sunshine gonna wash blues away
had sweet love i lost
she got close i fought
now i'm lost world trying find better way
wishing i knee deep water somewhere
got blue sky breeze seem fair
not worry world tide's gonna reach chair
sunrise fire sky
never happy
never felt high
and i think i might found kind paradise
wrote note said back minute
bought boat i sailed
don't think anybody gonna miss anyway
i'm permanent vacation
the ocean medication
wishing condition ain't gonna go away
cause now im knee deep water somewhere
got blue sky breeze blowing wind hair
not worry world tide's gonna reach chair
sunrise fire sky
never happy
never felt high
and i think i might found kind paradise
this champagne shore washing
it's sweet sweet life living salty sea
one day lost
change geography
maybe might
knee deep water somewhere
got blue sky breeze blowing wind hair
not worry world tide's gonna reach chair
sunrise fire sky
never happy
never felt high
and i think i might found kind paradise
come water's nice
find little slice
grab bag pack light
you never know try
when lose
you find key paradise

not tryna indie
not tryna cool
just tryna
tell
can feel wind
can feel
all windows
inside room
'cause i wanna touch baby
i wanna feel
i wanna see sunrise
sins
light run
let's make love tonight
make fall love try baby i'm right
but never alone
i'll dusk till dawn
i'll dusk till dawn
i'll hold things go wrong
i'll dusk till dawn
i'll dusk till dawn
baby i'm right
i'll dusk till dawn
we shut jacket
so zip
we roll rapids
to find wave fits
can feel wind
can feel
all windows
inside room
'cause i wanna touch baby
i wanna feel
i wanna see sunrise
sins
light run
let's make love tonight
make fall love try baby i'm right
but never alone
i'll dusk till dawn
i'll dusk till dawn
i'll hold things go wrong
i'll dusk till dawn
i'll dusk till dawn
baby i'm right
go give love body
it's stop
go give love body
it's stop
go give love body
it's stop
go give love body
but never alone
i'll dusk till dawn
i'll dusk till dawn
i'll hold things go wrong
i'll dusk till dawn
i'll dusk till dawn
baby i'm right
i'll dusk till dawn
baby i'm right

not tryna indie
