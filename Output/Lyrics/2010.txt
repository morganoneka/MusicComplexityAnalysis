i drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
i thought about our last kiss how it felt the way you tasted
and even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you
when he says those words that hurt you do you read the ones i wrote you
sometimes i start to wonder was it just a lie
if what we had was real how could you be fine
i remember the day you told me you were leaving
i remember the makeup running down your face
and the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
like every single wish we ever made
i wish that i could wake up with amnesia
and forget about the stupid little things
like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
and the memories i never can escape
cause i'm not fine at all
the pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
i'll admit i like to see them i'll admit i feel alone
all my friends keep asking why i'm not around
it hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
it's hard to hear your name when i haven't seen you in so long
it's like we never happened was it just a lie
if what we had was real how could you be fine
i remember the day you told me you were leaving
i remember the makeup running down your face
and the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
like every single wish we ever made
i wish that i could wake up with amnesia
and forget about the stupid little things
like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
and the memories i never can escape
if today i woke up with you right beside me
like all of this was just some twisted dream
i'd hold you closer than i ever did before
and you'd never slip away
and you'd never hear me say
i remember the day you told me you were leaving
i remember the makeup running down your face
and the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
like every single wish we ever made
i wish that i could wake up with amnesia
and forget about the stupid little things
like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
and the memories i never can escape
'cause i'm not fine at all
no i'm really not fine at all
tell me this is just a dream
'cause i'm really not fine at all
here i am waking up still can't sleep on your side
there's your coffee cup the lipstick stain fades with time
if i can dream long enough you'd tell me i'd be just fine
i'll be just fine
so i drown it out like i always do
dancing through our house with the ghost of you
and i chase it down with a shot of truth
dancing through our house with the ghost of you
cleaning up today found that old zepplin shirt
you wore when you ran away and no one could feel your hurt
we're too young too dumb to know things like love
but i know better now better now
so i drown it out like i always do
dancing through our house with the ghost of you
and i chase it down with a shot of truth
dancing through our house with the ghost of you
too young too dumb
to know things like love
too young too dumb
so i drown it out like i always do
dancing through our house with the ghost of you
and i chase it down with a shot of truth
that my feet don’t dance like they did with you

two days past eighteen
he was waitin' for the bus in his army green
sat down in a booth in a cafe there
he gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
he's a little shy so she give him a smile
and he said would you mind sittin' down for a while
and talkin' to me i'm feelin' a little low
she said i'm off in an hour and i know where we can go
so they went down and they sat on the pier
he said i bet you got a boyfriend but i don't care
i got no one to send a letter to
would you mind if i sent one back here to you
i cried
never gonna hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
our love will never end
waitin' for the soldier to come back again
never more to be alone
when the letter said a soldier's comin' home
so the letters came from an army camp
in california then afghanistan
and he told her of his heart it might be love
and all of the things that he was so scared of
he said when it's gettin' kinda rough over here
i think of that day sittin' down at the pier
and i close my eyes and see your pretty smile
don't worry but i won't be able to write for a while
i cried
never gonna hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
our love will never end
waitin' for the soldier to come back again
never more to be alone
when the letter said a soldier's comin' home
one friday night at a football game
the lord's prayer said and the anthem sang
a man said "folks would you bow your head
to a list of local soldiers dead"
cryin' all alone under the stands
was a piccolo player in the marchin' band
and one name read and nobody really cared
but the pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
i cried
never gonna hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
our love will never end
waitin' for the soldier to come back again
never more to be alone
when the letter said a soldier's comin'
i cried
never gonna hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
our love will never end
waitin' for the soldier to come back again
never more to be alone
when the letter said a soldier's comin' home
i will leave my heart at the door
i won't say a word
they've all been said before you know
so why don't we just play pretend
like we're not scared of what is coming next
or scared of having nothing left
look don't get me wrong i know
there is no tomorrow
all i ask is
if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'cause what if i never love again
i don't need
your honesty
it's already in your eyes
and i'm sure my eyes they speak for me
no one knows me like you do
and since you're the only one that matters
tell me who do i run to
now don't get me wrong i know
there is no tomorrow
all i ask is
if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'cause what if i never love again
let this be our lesson in love
let this be the way we remember us
i don't want to be cruel or vicious
and i ain't asking for forgiveness
all i ask is
if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'cause what if i never love again
hello it's me
i was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything
they say that time's supposed to heal you but i ain't done much healing
hello can you hear me
i'm in california dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger and free
i've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
there's such a difference between us
and a million miles
hello from the other side
i must've called a thousand times to tell you
i'm sorry for everything that i've done
but when i call you never seem to be home
hello from the outside
at least i can say that i've tried to tell you
i'm sorry for breaking your heart
but it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
hello how are you
it's so typical of me to talk about myself i'm sorry
i hope that you're well
did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened
it's no secret that the both of us
are running out of time
so hello from the other side
i must've called a thousand times to tell you
i'm sorry for everything that i've done
but when i call you never seem to be home
hello from the outside
at least i can say that i've tried to tell you
i'm sorry for breaking your heart
but it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
anymore oh ooooohh
anymore oh ooooohh
anymore oh ooooohh
anymore ohhhh anymore
so hello from the other side
i must've called a thousand times to tell you
i'm sorry for everything that i've done
but when i call you never seem to be home
hello from the outside
at least i can say that i've tried to tell you
i'm sorry for breaking your heart
but it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
take your eyes off of me so i can leave
i'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
this is never ending we have been here before
but i can't stay this time 'cause i don't love you anymore
please stay where you are
don't come any closer
don't try to change my mind
i'm being cruel to be kind
i can't love you in the dark
it feels like we're oceans apart
there's so much space between us
maybe we're already defeated
ehhh
everything changed me
you have given me something that i cant live without
you mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
but i don't want to carry on like everything is fine
the longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
please don't fall apart
i can't face your breaking heart
i'm trying to be brave
stop asking me to stay
i can't love you in the dark
it feels like we're oceans apart
there's so much space between us
maybe we're already defeated
ehhh
everything changed me
we are not the only ones
i don't regret a thing
every word i said
you know i'll always mean
it is the world to me
that you are in my life
but i want to live and not just survive
that's why i can't love you in the dark
it feels like we're oceans apart
there's so much space between us
maybe we're already defeated
'cause ehhh
everything changed me
and i
i don't think you can save me
i only wanted to have fun
learning to fly learning to run
i let my heart decide the way
when i was young
deep down i must have always known
that this would be inevitable
to earn my stripes i'd have to pay
and bare my soul
hmmm
hmmm
hmmm
i know i'm not the only one
who regrets the things they've done
sometimes i just feel it's only me
who can't stand the reflection that they see
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky not just the floor
i feel like my life is flashing by
and all i can do is watch and cry
i miss the air i miss my friends
i miss my mother i miss it when
life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years a go
when i walk around all of the streets
where i grew up and found my feet
they can't look me in the eye
it's like they're scared of me
i try to think of things to say
like a joke or a memory
but they don't recognize me now
in light of day
hmmm
hmmm
hmmm
i know i'm not the only one
who regrets the things they've done
sometimes i just feel it's only me
who never became who they thought they'd be
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky not just the floor
i feel like my life is flashing by
and all i can do is watch and cry
i miss the air i miss my friends
i miss my mother i miss it when
life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years a go
a million years a go
there's a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
finally i can see you crystal clear
go ahead and sell me out and i'll lay your shit bare
see how i'll leave with every piece of you
don't underestimate the things that i will do
there's a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
the scars of your love remind me of us
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love they leave me breathless
i can't help feeling
we could have had it all you're gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart you're gonna wish you inside of your hand never had met me
and you played it tears are gonna fall to the beat rolling in the deep
baby i have no story to be told
but i've heard one on you now i'm gonna make your head burn
think of me in the depths of your despair
make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
the scars of your love remind me of us you're gonna wish you never had met me
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
the scars of your love they leave me breathless you're gonna wish you never had met me

i let it fall my heart
and as it fell you rose to claim it
it was dark and i was over
until you kissed my lips and you saved me
my hands they're strong
but my knees were far too weak
to stand in your arms
without falling to your feet
but there's a side to you that i never knew never knew
all the things you'd say they were never true never true
and the games you'd play you would always win always win
but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well it burned while i cried
'cause i heard it screaming out your name your name
when i lay with you
i could stay there close my eyes
feel you here forever
you and me together nothing is better
'cause there's a side to you that i never knew never knew
all the things you'd say they were never true never true
and the games you'd play you would always win always win
but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well it burned while i cried
'cause i heard it screaming out your name your name
i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when we fell somethin' died
'cause i knew that that was the last time the last time
sometimes i wake up by the door
that heart you caught must be waitin' for you
even now when we're already over
i can't help myself from looking for you
i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well it burned while i cried
'cause i heard it screaming out your name your name
i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when we fell somethin' died
'cause i knew that that was the last time the last time
oooh oh no oh
let it burn oh

this is the end
hold your breath and count to ten
feel the earth move and then
hear my heart burst again
for this is the end
i've drowned and dreamt this moment
so overdue i owe them
swept away i'm stolen
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all together
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all together
at skyfall
at skyfall
skyfall is where we start
a thousand miles and poles apart
where worlds collide and days are dark
you may have my number you can take my name
but you'll never have my heart
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all together
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all together
at skyfall
where you go i go
what you see i see
i know i'll never be me without the security
of your loving arms
keeping me from harm
put your hand in my hand
and we'll stand
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all together
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all together
at skyfall
let the sky fall
we will stand tall
at skyfall

everybody loves the things you do
from the way you talk to the way you move
everybody here is watching you
cause you feel like home you're like a dream come true
but if by chance you're here alone
can i have a moment before i go
cause i've been by myself all night long
hoping you're someone i used to know
you look like a movie
you sound like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realized
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
it was just like a movie it was just like a song
i was so scared to face my fears
and nobody told me that you'd be here
and i swear you'd moved overseas
that's what you said when you left me
you still look like a movie
you still sound like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realized
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
it was just like a movie it was just like a song
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
it's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
to when you were there
to when you were there
and a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
i guess i still care
do you still care
it was just like a movie
it was just like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realized
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
oh i'm so mad i'm getting old it makes me reckless
it was just like a movie it was just like a song
when we were young
you were the shadow to my light
did you feel us
another star
you fade away
afraid our aim is out of sight
wanna see us
alight
where are you now
where are you now
where are you now
was it all in my fantasy
where are you now
were you only imaginary
where are you now
atlantis
under the sea
under the sea
where are you now
another dream
the monsters running wild inside of me
i'm faded
i'm faded
so lost i'm faded
i'm faded
so lost i'm faded
these shallow waters never met
what i needed
i'm letting go
a deeper dive
eternal silence of the sea
i'm breathing
alive
where are you now
where are you now
under the bright
you set my heart on fire
where are you now
where are you now
where are you now
atlantis
under the sea
under the sea
where are you now
another dream
the monsters running wild inside of me
i'm faded
i'm faded
so lost i'm faded
i'm faded
so lost i'm faded

this night is cold in the kingdom
i can feel you fade away
from the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
your steps keep me awake
don't cut me down throw me out leave me here to waste
i once was a man with dignity and grace
now i'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace

a little sympathy i hope you can show me

if you're leaving baby let me down slowly
let me down down let me down down

she told me that she loved me by the water fountain
she told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
and that was really lovely cause it was innocent
but now she's got a cup with something else in it
it's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten
and he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
she's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
forgetting what she told me by the water fountain
now he's grabbing her hips and pulling her in
kissing her lips and whispering in her
ear and she knows that she shouldn't listen
and that she should be with me by the water fountain
she couldn't be at home in the nighttime because
it made her feel alone but at that time she was
too young
i was too young
i should have built a home with a fountain for us
the moment that she told me that she was in love
too young
i was too young
too young
too young
too young
young
and if she ever goes back to the water fountain
the handle will be broken and the rust set in
but my hand it will be open and i'll try to fix it
my heart it will be open and i'll try to give it
now i'm grabbing her hips and pulling her in
kissing her lips and whispering in her
ear and i know that it's only a wish
and that we're not standing by the water fountain
too young
too young
too young
young
she couldn't be at home in the nighttime because
it made her feel alone but at that time she was
too young
i was too young
i should have built a home with a fountain for us
the moment that she told me that she was in love
too young
i was too young
too young
too young
too young
young
i should have built a home with a fountain for us
the moment that she told me that she was in love
too young
i was too young
she just wants to be
beautiful she goes
unnoticed she knows
no limits she craves
attention she praises
she prays to be
sculpted by the sculptor
oh she don't see
the light that's shining
deeper than the eyes can find it
maybe we have made her blind
so she tries to cover up her pain
and cut her woes away
'cause covergirls don't cry
but there's a hope
that's waiting for you in the dark
you should know you're beautiful
just the way you are
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful
we're stars and we're beautiful
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful
we're stars and we're beautiful
she has dreams to be
an envy so she's
covergirls eat nothing she says
"beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"what's a little bit of hunger"
she fades away
she don't see her perfect
she don't understand she's worth it
or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
oh oh
oh oh
so to all the girls that's hurting
let me be your mirror
help you see a little bit clearer
there's a hope
that's waiting for you in the dark
you should know you're beautiful
just the way you are
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful
we're stars and we're beautiful
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful
we're stars and we're beautiful
there's a hope
that's waiting for you in the dark
you should know you're beautiful
just the way you are
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful
we're stars and we're beautiful
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful
we're stars and we're beautiful
little do you know
how i'm breaking while you fall asleep
little do you know
i'm still haunted by the memories
little do you know
i'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece
little do you know i need a little more time
underneath it all i'm held captive by the hole inside
i've been holding back for the fear that you might change your mind
i'm ready to forgive you but forgetting is a harder fight
little do you know i need a little more time
i'll wait i'll wait
i love you like you've never felt
the pain i'll wait
i promise you don't have to be afraid i'll wait
the love is here and here to stay so lay your head on me
little do you know
i know you're hurtin' while i'm sound asleep
little do you know
all my mistakes are slowly drowning me
little do you know
i'm trying to make it better piece by piece
little do you know i i love you till the sun dies
oh wait just wait
i love you like i've never felt
the pain just wait
i love you like i've never been afraid just wait
our love is here and here to stay so lay your head on me
i'll wait oh wait i'll wait oh wait

i promise youi don't have to be afraid i'll wait
the love is here and here to stay so lay your head on me
lay your head on me
so lay your head on me
'cause little do you know i
love you till the sun dies
i etched the face of a stopwatch
on the back of a raindrop
and did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
i heard an unhappy ending it sort of sounds like you're leaving
i heard the piledriver waltz it woke me up this morning
you look like youve been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in a back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose
your waitress was miserable and so was your food
if you’re gonna try and walk on water make sure you wear your comfortable
mysteries flashing amber go green when you answer but the red on the rest of
the questionnaire never changes
i heard the news that youre planning to shoot me out of a cannon
i heard the piledriver waltz it woke me up this morning
you look like youve been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in a back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose
your waitress was miserable and so was your food
if youre gonna try and walk on water make sure you wear your comfortable
ooooh piledriver

a or
am or
i'm not the kind of fool who's gonna sit and sing to you about stars girl
but last night i look up into the dark half of the blue and they've gone backwards
something in your magnetism must have pissed them off
forcing them to get an early night
i have been searching from the bottom to the top for such a sight
as the one i caught when i saw your
fingers dimming the lights
like you're used to being told that you're trouble
and i spent all night stuck on the puzzle
nobody i asked knew how he came to be the one to whom you surrendered
any man who wasn't led away into the other room stood pretending
that something in your magnetism hadn't just made him drop
whoever's hand it was that he was holding
i have been searching from the bottom to the top for such a sight
as the one i caught when i saw your
fingers dimming the lights
like you're used to being told that you're trouble
and i spent all night stuck on the puzzle
i tried to swim to the side
but my feet got caught in the middle
and i thought id seen the light
but oh no
i was just stuck on the puzzle
stuck on the puzzle
she's just a girl and she's on fire
hotter than a fantasy lonely like a highway
she's living in a world and it's on fire

and she's burning it down
ohohooh ooh ohohooh she got her head in the clouds

and we're not coming down

and it's a lonely world
but she gon' let it burn baby burn baby

i will always remember
the day you kissed my lips
light as a feather
and it went just like this
no it's never been better
than the summer of
we were only eleven
but acting like grownups
like we are in the present
drinking from plastic cups
singing love is forever and ever
well i guess that was true
dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
of an old mustang where we sang
songs with all our childhood friends
oops i got problems singing bye bye bye
hold up if you wanna go and take a ride with me
better hit me baby one more time
paint a picture for you and me
of the days when we were young
singing at the top of both our lungs
now we're under the covers
fast forward to eighteen
we are more than lovers
yeah we are all we need
when we're holding each other
i'm taken back to
dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
of an old mustang where we sang
songs with all our childhood friends
oops i got problems singing bye bye bye
hold up if you wanna go and take a ride with me
better hit me baby one more time
paint a picture for you and me
of the days when we were young
singing at the top of both our lungs
on the day we fell in love
on the day we fell in love
dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
of an old mustang where we sang
songs with all our childhood friends
oops i got problems singing bye bye bye
hold up if you wanna go and take a ride with me
better hit me baby one more time
paint a picture for you and me
of the days when we were young
singing at the top of both our lungs
on the day we fell in love
on the day we fell in love
on the day we fell in love
on the day we fell in love
on the day we fell in love love love
in the suburbs i i learned to drive
and you told me we’d never survive grab your mother’s keys we’re leaving
you always seemed so sure that one day we’d be fighting
in a suburban war your part of town against mine
i saw you standing on the opposite shore but by the time the first bombs fell
we were already bored we were already already bored
sometimes i can’t believe it i’m moving past the feeling
sometimes i can’t believe it i’m moving past the feeling
again
the kids wanna be so hard but in my dreams we’re still screaming
and running through the yard when all of the walls that they built
in the seventies finally fall and all of the houses they built
in the seventies finally fall meant nothing at all meant nothing at all it meant nothing
sometimes i can’t believe it i’m moving past the feeling
sometimes i can’t believe it i’m moving past the feeling
and into the night
so can you understand why i want a daughter
while i’m still young i wanna hold her hand and show her some beauty
before all this damage is done but if it’s too much to ask
if it’s too much to ask then send me a son
under the overpass in the parking lot we’re still waiting
it’s already passed so move your feet from hot pavement
and into the grass 'cause it’s already past it’s already already past
sometimes i can’t believe it i’m moving past the feeling
sometimes i can’t believe it i’m moving past the feeling
again i'm moving past the feeling
i’m moving past the feeling
in my dreams
we're still screaming
we’re still screaming
we’re still screaming
arabella's got some interstellargator skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams
my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you cant be sure
arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place
my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you cant be sure
that's magic in a cheetah print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
asking if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips round the mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you cant be sure

have you got color in your cheeks
do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
are there some aces up your sleeve
have you no idea that you're in deep
how many secrets can you keep
'cause there's this tune i found that makes me think of you somehow and i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep
spilling drinks on my settee
do i wanna know
if this feeling flows both ways
sad to see you go
baby we both know
that the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
crawling back to you
ever thought of calling when you've had a few
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through
crawling back to you
so have you got the guts
been wondering if your heart's still open and if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and pucker up
i'm sorry to interrupt it's just i'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to
do i wanna know
if this feeling flows both ways
sad to see you go
baby we both know
that the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
crawling back to you
ever thought of calling when you've had a few
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through
crawling back to you
if this feeling flows both ways
sad to see you go
baby we both know
that the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
do i wanna know
too busy being yours to fall
sad to see you go
ever thought of calling darling
do i wanna know
do you want me crawling back to you
i wanna be your vacuum cleaner
breathing in your dust
i wanna be your ford cortina
i will never rust
if you like your coffee hot
let me be your coffee pot
you call the shots babe
i just wanna be yours
secrets i have held in my heart
are harder to hide than i thought
maybe i just wanna be yours
i wanna be yours
i wanna be yooooooours
wanna be yooooooours
wanna be yooooooours
wanna be yooooours
let me be your leccy meter
and i'll never run out
let me be the portable heater
that you’ll get cold without
i wanna be your setting lotion wanna be
hold your hair in deep devotion how deep
i wanna be yours
secrets i have held in my heart
are harder to hide than i thought
maybe i just wanna be yours
i wanna be yours
i wanna be yooooooours

wanna be your vacuum cleaner
breathing in your dust
i wanna be your ford cortina
i'll never rust
i just wanna be yours
i just wanna be yours
i just wanna be yours
so you're on the prowl wondering whether
she left already or not
leather jacket collar popped like cantona
never knowing when to stop
sunglasses indoors par for the course
lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
cages and poles
call off the search for your soul
or put it on hold again
she's having a sly indoor smoke
and she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
as all the signals are sent her eyes invite you to approach
and it seems as though those lumps in your throat
that you just swallowed have got you going
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
number one party anthem
she's a certified mind blower
knowing full well that i don't
may suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her
just to get the ball to roll
drunken monologues confused because
it's not like i'm falling in love
i just want you to do me no good
and you look like you could
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
number one party anthem
come on come on come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem
yeah yeah
the look of love the rush of blood
the "she's with me" the gallic shrug
the shutterbugs the camera plus
the black white the colour dodge
the good time girls the cubicles
the house of fun the number one party anthem
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
i'm a puppet on a string tracy island timetraveling diamond
cutter shaped heartaches come to find ya fall in some velvet morning
years too late she's a silver lining lone ranger riding
through an open space in my mind when she's not right there beside me
i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself all i wanna hear her say is "are you mine "
are you mine
are you mine
are you mine oh are
i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end keep imagining meeting
wished away entire lifetimes unfair we're not somewhere
misbehaving for days great escape
lost track of time and space she's a silver lining climbing on my desire and
i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself all i wanna hear her say is "are you mine "
are you mine are you mine tomorrow
are you mine or just mine tonight
are you mine are you mine mine
and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case i'm mistaken
i just wanna hear you say you got me baby
are you mine
i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself all i wanna hear her say is "are you mine "
are you mine are you mine tomorrow
are you mine or just mine tonight
are you mine are you mine tomorrow or just mine tonight
what's been happening in your world oh
i heard that you fell in love

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it snap out of it
i get the feeling i left it too late but baby

the mirror's image tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished 'cause you're not by my side
and as i arrived i thought i saw you leaving carrying your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreaming of bumping into you
now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
why'd you only call me when you're high

blindsided addicted

hindsight it's obvious
talking with my lawyer

with the wrong people sometimes"

it's funny how a memory
turns into a bad dream
when running wild turns volatile
remember how we painted our house
just like my grandparents did
so romantic but we fought the whole time
should've seen the signs yeah
talking with my mother
she said "where’d you find this guy"
said "some people fall in love
with the wrong people sometimes"
some mistakes get made
that's alright that's okay
you can think that you’re in love
when you're really just in pain
some mistakes get made
that's alright that's okay
in the end it's better for me
hahha hahahahahooh
hahha hahahahahooh
hahha hahahahahooh
hahha hahahahahooh
they say it's better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all
that could be a load of shit
but i just need to tell you all
some mistakes get made
that's alright that's okay
you can think that you're in love
when you're really just engaged

on my shelf da di da

never feared for anything
never shamed but never free
a life to heal the broken heart
with all that it could
lived the life so endlessly
saw beyond what others see
i tried to heal your broken heart
with all that i could
will you stay
will you stay away forever
how do i live without the ones i love
time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
place and time always on my mind
i have so much to say but you're so far away
plans of what our futures hold
foolish lies of growing old
it seems we're so invincible
the truth is so cold
a final song a last request
a perfect chapter laid to rest
now and then i try to find
the place in my mind
where you can stay
you can stay awake forever
how do i live without the ones i love
time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
place and time always on my mind
i have so much to say but you're so far away
sleep tight
i'm not afraid not afraid
the ones that we love are here with me
lay away
a place for me place for me
'cause as soon as i'm done
i'll be on my way
to live eternally
how do i live without the ones i love
time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
place and time always on my mind
and the light you left remains
but it so hard to stay
and i have so much to say and you're so far away
i love you
you were ready
the pain is strong and urges rise
but i'll see you
when he lets me
your pain is gone your hands untied
so far away and i need you to know
so far away and i need you to need you to know

hey once upon a younger year
the animals inside came out to play
hey when face to face with all our fears
made memories we knew would never fade
one day my father he told me
son don't let this slip away
he took me in his arms i heard him say
when you get older
your wild heart will live for younger days
think of me if ever you're afraid
he said one day you'll leave this world behind
so live a life you will remember
my father told me when i was just a child
these are the nights that never die
my father told me
when thunder clouds start pouring down
carve your name into those shining stars
he said go venture far beyond these shores
i'll guide you home no matter where you are
one day my father he told me
son don't let this slip away
when i was just a kid i heard him say
when you get older
your wild heart will live for younger days
think of me if ever you're afraid
he said one day you'll leave this world behind
so live a life you will remember
my father told me when i was just a child
these are the nights that never die
my father told me
these are the nights that never die
my father told me
feeling my way through the darkness
guided by a beating heart
i can't tell where the journey will end
but i know where it starts
they tell me i'm too young to understand
they say i'm caught up in a dream
well life will pass me by if i don't open up my eyes
well that's fine by me
so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself and i
didn't know i was lost
so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself and i
didn't know i was lost
i tried carrying the weight of the world
but i only have two hands
hope i get the chance to travel the world
but i don't have any plans
i wish that i could stay forever this young
not afraid to close my eyes
life's a game made for everyone
and love is the prize
so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself and i
didn't know i was lost
so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself and i
didn't know i was lost

you said that we would always be
without you i feel lost at sea
through the darkness you'd hide with me
like the wind we'd be wild and free
you said you'd follow me anywhere
but your eyes tell me you won't be there
i gotta learn how to love without you
i gotta carry my cross without you
stuck in a riddle and i'm just about to
figure it out without you
and i'm done sittin' home without you
fuck i'm goin' out without you
i'm going to tear this city down without you
i'm going bonnie and clyde without you
now i'm running away my dear
from myself and the truth i fear
my heart is beatin' i can't see clear
how i'm wishing that you were here
you said you'd follow me anywhere
but your eyes tell me you won't be there
i gotta learn how to love without you
i gotta carry my cross without you
stuck in a riddle and i'm just about to
figure it out without you
and i'm done sittin' home without you
fuck i'm goin' out without you
i'm going to tear this city down without you
i'm going bonnie and clyde without you
i was left to my own devices
many days fell away with nothing to show
and the walls kept tumbling down
in the city that we loved
great clouds roll over the hills
bringing darkness from above
but if you close your eyes
does it almost feel like
nothing changed at all
and if you close your eyes
does it almost feel like
you've been here before
how am i gonna be an optimist about this
how am i gonna be an optimist about this
we were caught up and lost in all of our vices
in your pose as the dust settles around us
and the walls kept tumbling down
in the city that we loved
great clouds roll over the hills
bringing darkness from above
but if you close your eyes
does it almost feel like
nothing changed at all
and if you close your eyes
does it almost feel like
you've been here before
how am i gonna be an optimist about this
how am i gonna be an optimist about this
oh where do we begin
the rubble or our sins
oh where do we begin
the rubble or our sins
and the walls kept tumbling down
in the city that we loved
great clouds roll over the hills
bringing darkness from above
but if you close your eyes
does it almost feel like
nothing changed at all
and if you close your eyes
does it almost feel like
you've been here before
how am i gonna be an optimist about this
how am i gonna be an optimist about this
but if you close your eyes
does it almost feel like
nothing changed at all



you haven't been good for long
is it the sound of your own thoughts
that always keeps you up at night
maybe it's time to say goodbye
ba ba ba
ba ba ba

you haven't felt right for days
is it the fact you never say
what comes in your mind that day
maybe it's time to shut away

to give my brain some extra space to think
'bout all the things to do to help

they say beauty is pain you'll only be happy

jesus christ you're so confusing
if we keep score
bet my money that i'm losing

from an empty sea
a flash of light
it will take awhile
to make you smile
somewhere in these eyes
i'm on your side
you wide eye'd girl
you get it right
fall back into place
fall back into place
tender is the night
for a broken heart
who will dry your eyes
when it falls apart
what makes this fragile world go 'round

was she ever found
somewhere in these eyes
fall back into place
fall back into place

years days makes no difference to me babe
you look exactly the same to me
ain’t no time crossing your legs inside the diner
raising your coffee to your lips the steam
you saw the masterpiece she looks a lot like you
wrapping her left arm around your right
ready to walk you through the night
you whisper to a restless ear “can you get me out of here
this place smells like piss and beer can you get me out”
you were asking me how to get you free
i only know the recipe to roam
you saw the masterpiece she looks a lot like you
wrapping her left arm around your right
ready to walk you through the night
old stars
filling up my throat
you gave em to me when i was born
now they’re coming out
laying there on the hospital bed your eyes were narrow blue and red
you took a draw of breath and said to me
you saw the masterpiece she looks a lot like me
wrapping my left arm around your right
ready to walk you through the night
old friends
old mothers dogs and brothers
there’s only so much letting go you can ask someone to do
so i keep you by my side i will not give you to the tide
i'll even walk you in my stride marie
'cause i saw the masterpiece and she looks a lot like you
wrapping your left arm around my right
ready to walk me through the night
oh the last time i saw paul
i was horrible and almost let him in
but i stopped and caught the wall
and my mouth got dry so all i did was take him for a spin
yeah we hopped inside my car
and i drove in circles 'round the freight train yard
and he turned the headlights off
then he pulled the bottle out
then he showed me what was love
i'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
i'll be your record player baby if you know what i mean
i'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
i'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death
in the blossom of the months
i was sure that i'd get driven off with thought
so i swallowed all of it
as i realized there was no one who could kiss away my shit
i'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
i'll be your record player baby if you know what i mean
i'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
i'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death
paul i know you said that you'd take me any way i came or went
but i'll push you from my brain
see you're gentle baby
i couldn't stay i'd only bring you pain
i was your starryeyed lover and the one that you saw
i was your hurricane rider and the woman you'd call
we were just two moonshiners on the cusp of a breath
and i've been burning for you baby since the minute i left
she was a shark smile in a yellow van
she came around and i stole a glance
in my youth a vampire
evelyn shown quiet as roses sting
it came over me at a bad time
but who wouldn't ride on a moonlight line
i had her in my eye down the road of a deadend gleam
and she said woo
baby take me
and i said woo
baby take me too
it came over her at a bad time
riding through winona down the dotted line
held us gunning out
miles down the road of a dead end dream
she looked over with a part smile
caught up in the twinkle it could take awhile
and the money pile on the dashboard fluttering
as she said woo
baby take me
and i said woo
baby take me too
evelyn's kiss was oxygen
i leaned over to take it in
as we went howling through the edge of south des moines
it came over me at a bad time
she burned over the double line
and she impaled as i reached my hand for the guardrail
ooh the guardrail
ooh the guardrail
as she said woo
baby take me
and i said woo
baby take me too
as she said woo
baby take me
and i said woo
baby take me too
my lucifer is lonely

you'll never know until you try it

i had a dream
i got everything i wanted
not what you think
and if i'm being honest
it might have been a nightmare
to anyone who might care
thought i could fly
so i stepped off the golden
nobody cried
nobody even noticed
i saw them standing right there
kinda thought they might care
i had a dream
i got everything i wanted
but when i wake up i see
you're with me
and you say
as long as i'm here
no one can hurt you
don't wanna lie here
but you can learn to
if i could change
the way that you see yourself
you wouldn't wonder why you hear
"they don't deserve you"
i tried to scream
but my head was under water
they called me weak
like i'm not just somebody's daughter
could've been a nightmare
but it felt like they were right there
and it feels like yesterday was a year ago
but i don't wanna let anybody know
cause everybody wants something from me now
and i don't wanna let 'em down
i had a dream
i got everything i wanted
but when i wake up i see
you're with me
and you say
as long as i'm here
no one can hurt you
don't wanna lie here
but you can learn to
if i could change
the way that you see yourself
you wouldn't wonder why you hear
"they don't deserve you"
if i knew it all then
would i do it again
would i do it again
if they knew what they said
would go straight to my head
what would they say instead
if i knew it all then
would i do it again
would i do it again
if they knew what they said
would go straight to my head
what would they say instead


i wanna be alone
alone with you does that make sense
i wanna steal your soul
and hide you in my treasure chest
i don't know what to do
to do with your kiss on my neck
i don't know what feels true
but this feels right so stay a sec
yeah you feel right so stay a sec
and let me crawl inside your veins
i'll build a wall give you a ball and chain
it's not like me to be so mean
you're all i wanted
just let me hold you
like a hostage
gold on your fingertips
fingertips against my cheek
gold leaf across your lips
kiss me until i can't speak
gold chain beneath your shirt
the shirt that you let me wear home
gold's fake and real love hurts
but nothing hurts when i'm alone
when you're with me and we're alone
and let me crawl inside your veins
i'll build a wall give you a ball and chain
it's not like me to be so mean
you're all i wanted
just let me hold you
hold you
like a hostage
like a hostage
it's not true
tell me i’ve been lied to
crying isn't like you ooh
what the hell did i do
never been the type to
let someone see right through ooh
maybe won't you take it back
say you were tryna make me laugh
and nothing has to change today
you didn’t mean to say "i love you"
i love you and i don't want to ooh
up all night
on another redeye
i wish we never learned to fly iii
maybe we should just try
to tell ourselves a good lie
i didn't mean to make you cry iii
maybe won't you take it back
say you were tryna make me laugh
and nothing has to change today
you didn’t mean to say "i love you"
i love you and i don't want to ooh
the smile that you gave me
even when you felt like dying
we fall apart as it gets dark
i'm in your arms in central park
there's nothing you could do or say
i can’t escape the way i love you
i don’t want to but i love you ooh
ooh ooh
ooh ooh
don't be that way
fall apart twice a day
i just wish you could feel what you say
show never tell
but i know you too well
kind of mood that you wish you could sell
if teardrops could be bottled
there'd be swimming pools filled by models
told "that tight dress is what makes you a whore"
if "i love you" was a promise
would you break it if you're honest
tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
idontwannabeyouanymore
hands getting cold
losing feeling's getting old
was i made from a broken mold
hurt i can't shake
we've made every mistake
only you know the way that i break
if teardrops could be bottled
there'd be swimming pools filled by models
told "that tight dress is what makes you a whore"
if "i love you" was a promise
would you break it if you're honest
tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
idontwannabeyou
idontwannabeyou
idontwannabeyou anymore

i wanna see the world when i stop breathing
turning blue

'cause i'm leaving soon
sorry can't save me now

'cause i'm leaving soon

but if you want a good girl then goodbye
you want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine
i’ve been watching you for some time
can’t stop staring at those ocean eyes
burning cities and napalm skies
fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
your ocean eyes
no fair
you really know how to make me cry
when you gimme those ocean eyes
i'm scared
i've never fallen from quite this high
falling into your ocean eyes
those ocean eyes
i've been walking through a world gone blind
can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
careful creature made friends with time
he left her lonely with a diamond mind
and those ocean eyes
no fair
you really know how to make me cry
when you gimme those ocean eyes
i'm scared
i've never fallen from quite this high
falling into your ocean eyes
those ocean eyes
no fair
you really know how to make me cry
when you gimme those ocean eyes
i'm scared
i've never fallen from quite this high
falling into your ocean eyes
those ocean eyes
hey call me back
when you get this
or when you've got a minute
we really need to talk
wait you know what
maybe just forget it
cause by the time you get this
your number might be blocked

you just want what you can't have
no wait i'll call the cops
if you don't stop i'll call your dad
and i hate to do this to you on your birthday

you know that's bullshit
don't you babe
i'm not your party favor
look now i know we could've done it better
but we can't change the weather
and the weather's come and gone
books don't make sense if you read them backwards
you'll single out the wrong words
like you mishear all my songs

you just want what you can't have
no wait i'll call the cops
if you don't stop i'll call your dad
and i hate to do this to you on your birthday

help i lost myself again
but i remember you
don’t come back it won’t end well
but i wish you’d tell me to
our love is six feet under
i can’t help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
would roses bloom
could roses bloom
again
retrace my lips erase your touch
it's all too much for me
blow away like smoke in air
how can you die carelessly
our love is six feet under
i can’t help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
would roses bloom
could roses bloom
they're playin us out layin us down tonight
and all of these clouds cryin us back to life
but you're cold as a knife
six feet under
i can’t help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
bloom
bloom
again
help i lost myself again
but i remember you
lips meet teeth and tongue
my heart skips eight beats at once
if we were meant to be we would have been by now
see what you wanna see but all i see is him right now
i'll sit and watch your car burn
with the fire that you started in me
but you never came back to ask it out
go ahead and watch my heart burn
with the fire that you started in me
but i'll never let you back to put it out
your love feels so fake
and my demands aren't high to make
if i could get to sleep i would have slept by now
your lies will never keep i think you need to blow 'em out
i'll sit and watch your car burn
with the fire that you started in me
but you never came back to ask it out
go ahead and watch my heart burn
with the fire that you started in me
but i'll never let you back to put it out
when you call my name
do you think i'll come runnin'
you never did the same
so good at givin' me nothin'
when you close your eyes do you picture me
when you fantasize am i your fantasy
now you know
now i'm free
i'll sit and watch your car burn
with the fire that you started in me
but you never came back to ask it out
watch my heart burn
with the fire that you started in me
but i'll never let you back to put it out
woo woo woo

i could lie and say i like it like that like it like that
i could lie and say i like it like that like it like that
what is it about them
i must be missing something
they just keep doing nothing
too intoxicated to be scared
better off without them
they're nothing but unstable
bring ashtrays to the table
and that's about the only thing they share
i'm in their secondhand smoke
still just drinking canned coke
i don't need a xanny to feel better
on designated drives home
only one who's not stoned
don't give me a xanny now or ever
wakin' up at sundown ooh
they're late to every party ooh
nobody's ever sorry ooh
too inebriated now to dance
morning as they come down come down
their pretty heads are hurting hurting
they're awfully bad at learning learning
make the same mistakes blame circumstance
i'm in their secondhand smoke
still just drinking canned coke
i don't need a xanny to feel better
on designated drives home
only one who's not stoned
don't give me a xanny now or ever
please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
on your cigarette break
i can't afford to love someone
who isn't dying by mistake in silver lake
what is it about them
i must be missing something
they just keep doin' nothing
hmm hmm
hmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
come down
hurting
learning

i ain't slept in seven days
haven't ate in three
methamphetamine has got a damn good hold of me
my tweaker friends have got me to the point of no return
i just took my lighter to the bulb and watched it burn
this life of sin life of sin it's got me in got me in
lord it's got me back in prison once again
i used my only phone call to contact my daddy
i got twenty long years for some dust in a baggie
well if i would have listened to what
mom and papa said
i wouldn't be locked up in prison troubled in the head
lord i took that little pop and suck until my mind was spun
i got twenty years to sit and think of what i've done
this life of sin life of sin it's got me in got me in
lord it's got me back in prison once again
i used my only phone call to contact my daddy
i got twenty long years for some dust in a baggie
sometimes i sit and wonder
where my little life went wrong
these old jailhouse blues have got me singing this old song
well my life is a disaster
and i feel so ashamed
in here where they call me by a number not a name
this life of sin life of sin it's got me in got me in
lord it's got me back in prison once again
i used my only phone call to contact my daddy
i got twenty long years for some dust in a baggie
i used my only phone call to contact my daddy

god knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
i guess he kissed the girls and made them cry
those hardfaced queens of misadventure
god knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes
a fiery throng of muted angels
giving love but getting nothing back
people help the people
and if you're homesick
give me your hand and i'll hold it
people help the people
and nothing will drag you down
oh and if i had a brain
oh and if i had a brain
i'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
that turned all those good hearts away
god knows what is hiding in this world of little consequence
behind the tears inside the lies
a thousand slowly dying sunsets
god knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
i guess the loneliness came knocking
no one needs to be alone oh save me
people help the people
and if you're homesick
give me your hand and i'll hold it
people help the people
and nothing will drag you down
oh and if i had a brain

right outside of this one church town
there's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
got a deed to the land but it ain't my ground
this is god's country
we pray for rain thank him when it's fallin'
'cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
we put it back in the plate i guess that's why
they call it god's country
i saw the light in the sunrise
sittin' back in the on a muddy riverside
gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
with the dogs running
saved by the sound of the been found
dixie whistled in the wind that'll get you heaven bound
the devil went down to georgia but he didn't stick around
this is god's country
we turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
we take a break and break bread on sunday
and then do it all again 'cause we're proud to be
from god's country yeah yeah
i saw the light in the sunrise
sittin' back in the on a muddy riverside
gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
with the dogs running
saved by the sound of the been found
dixie whistled in the wind that'll get you heaven bound
the devil went down to georgia but he didn't stick around
this is god's country yeah
i don't care what my headstone reads
and what kind of pine wood box i end up in
when it's my time lay me six feet deep
in god's country yeah yeah
i saw the light in the sunrise
sittin' back in the on a muddy riverside
gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
with the dogs running
saved by the sound of the been found
dixie whistled in the wind that'll get you heaven bound
the devil went down to georgia but he didn't stick around
this is god's country god's country
i saw the light in the sunrise
sittin' back in the on a muddy riverside
gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
with the dogs running
saved by the sound of the been found
dixie whistled in the wind that'll get you heaven bound
the devil went down to georgia but he didn't stick around
this is god's country

even though we forgot to eat
and you had a bad dream
then we got no sleep
'cause we were kissing
until i met you
now you make me cool
but sometimes i still do
something embarrassing
i never said i'd be all right
just thought i can hold myself together
but i couldn't breathe i went outside
don't know why i thought it'd be any better
i'm fine now it doesn't matter
i didn't wanna be this guy
i cried at your show with the teenagers
tell your friend i'll be all right
in the morning it won't matter
i wanna be emaciated
i wanna hear one song without thinking of you
i wish i was on a spaceship
just me and my dog and an impossible view
i dream about it
and i wake up falling
dreamcatcher in the rearview mirror
hasn’t caught a thing yet
twenty dollars in souvenirs
anything’s worth trying
to stay out of your nightmares
see i was in your dream last night
always end up dying
you said because of course i did
oohohoh
oohohoh
always managed to move in
right next to the cemeteries
and never far from hospitals i don't know what
that tells you about me
pulling thorns out of my palm
work a midnight surgery
when you cut a hole into my skull
do you hate what you see
like i do
oohohoh
oohohoh
oohohoh
oohohoh
oohohoh
you're feeling nervous aren't you boy
with your quiet voice and impeccable style
don't ever let them steal your joy
and your gentle ways to keep 'em from running wild
dress you down and tell you that your place
is in the middle when they hate the way you shine
i see you tugging on your shirt
trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts
let 'em laugh while they can
let 'em spin let 'em scatter in the wind
i have been to the movies i've seen how it ends
and the joke's on them
you get discouraged don't you girl
it's your brother's world for a while longer
we gotta dance with the devil on a river
to beat the stream
call it living the dream call it kicking the ladder
they come to kick dirt in your face
to call you weak and then displace you
after carrying your baby on your back across the desert
i saw your eyes behind your hair
and you're looking tired but you don't look scared
let 'em laugh while they can
let 'em spin let 'em scatter in the wind
i have been to the movies i've seen how it ends
and the joke's on them
let 'em laugh while they can
let 'em spin let 'em scatter in the wind
i have been to the movies i've seen how it ends
and the joke's on them
what doesn't kill you
makes you wish you were dead
got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
and i can't take
one more moment of this silence
the loneliness is haunting me
and the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up
it comes in waves i close my eyes
hold my breath and let it bury me
i'm not ok and it's not all right
won't you drag the lake and bring me home again
who will fix me now
dive in when i'm down
save me from myself
don't let me drown
who will make me fight
drag me out alive
save me from myself
don't let me drown
what doesn't destroy you
leaves you broken instead
got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
and i can't take
one more moment of this silence
the loneliness is haunting me
and the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up
it comes in waves i close my eyes
hold my breath and let it bury me
i'm not ok and it's not all right
won't you drag the lake and bring me home again
who will fix me now
dive in when i'm down
save me from myself
don't let me drown
who will make me fight
drag me out alive
save me from myself
don't let me drown
'cos you know that i can't do this on my own
'cos you know that i can't do this on my own
'cos you know that i can't do this on my own
'cos you know that i can't do this on my own
who will fix me now
who will fix me now
who will fix me now
dive in when i'm down
save me from myself
don't let me drown
i'm freakin' out on the interstate
rolling down the windows baby i can't hear a thing you say
i'm walking back to my favorite place
and i can feel them staring at me
baby do you think i'm doing something wrong
and you got a lot on your mind
and your heart it looks just like mine
there's no use in wasting your time anymore
i'm sorry i haven't been myself
and something's got me down
what it is i cannot tell
i won't be satisfied with anything i've earned
fear is just a part of love
and one thing i found
driving home and call my father on the telephone
i hope you know i missed you man
let's put it all behind us if we can
never feeling like i'm all the way home all the way home
stones inside my raincoat pocket i gotta keep
and you got a lot on your mind
and your heart it looks just like mine
there's no use in wasting your time anymore
i'm sorry i haven't been myself
and something's got me down
what it is i cannot tell
i won't be satisfied with anything i've earned
fear is just a part of love
and one thing i found
i'm sorry i haven't been myself
and something's got me down
what it is i cannot tell
i won't be terrified with anything i've earned
fear is just a part of love
and one thing i found
don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
call it quits call it destiny
just because it won't come easily
doesn't mean we shouldn't try
we had a good thing going lately
might not have always been a fairytale
but you know and i know that they ain't real
you might've tried my patience greatly
but i'm not about to let us fail
i'll be the wind picking up your sail
don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
call it quits call it destiny
just because it won't come easily
doesn't mean we shouldn't try
coming and going inside out back to front
all tangled and messy that's how we've been and
don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
call it quits call it destiny
just because it won't come easily
doesn't mean we shouldn't try
try try just because it won't come easily
doesn't mean we shouldn't try
just because it won't come easily
doesn't mean we shouldn't try
try try just because it won't come easily

our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
when our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
cause my heart breaks a little when i hear your name
it all just sounds like ooh ooh oooh oooh
mmm too young too dumb to realize
that i should've bought you flowers and held your hand
shoulda gave you all my hours when i had the chance
take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
now my baby's dancing but she's dancing with another man
my pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways
caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
now i'll never never get to clean up the mess i made ooh
and that haunts me every time i close my eyes
it all just sounds like ooh ooh oooh oooh
mmm too young too dumb to realize
that i should've bought you flowers and held your hand
shoulda gave you all my hours when i had the chance
take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
now my baby's dancing but she's dancing with another man
although it hurts i'll be the first to say that i was wrong
oh i know i'm probably much too late
to try and apologize for my mistakes
but i just want you to know
i hope he buys you flowers i hope he holds your hand
give you all his hours when he has the chance
take you to every party cause i remember how much you love to dance
do all the things i should've done when i was your man
do all the things i should've done when i was your man
driving through west virginia
and i've seldom been thinner
with that chip on my shoulder
and this past year i got so much older
looking back over my life
spent the most of it tonguetied
and i wish i had more time
listening to you speak your mind
now i'm thinking 'bout her every day
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
thinking 'bout her every day
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
drinking coffee black as iron
and i couldn't be much higher
without falling out of my chair
i've been so numb for so many years
now i'm thinking 'bout her every day
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
thinking 'bout her every day
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
and it's so easy
to be blinded by the light
to feel lonely in the night
and it's blowing in the breeze babe
i got dust in my eyes
and rust in my mind
i'll be home come next spring
won't you say you love me later
by and by
looking back over my life
spent the most of it tonguetied
pulling my belt tight
it's just me and the stars tonight
two fingers and a tide line
keep my head head above the alpine
just wish i'd spent more time
listening to her speak her mind
now i'm thinking 'bout her every day
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
thinking 'bout her every day
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
now i'm thinking 'bout her every day
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
thinking 'bout her every day
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
to me
did you stand there all alone
oh i cannot explain what's going down
i can see you standing next to me
in and out somewhere else right now
you sigh look away
i can see it clear as day
close your eyes so afraid
hide behind that baby face
do do do do do do
you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wanna find peace of mind
looking for the answer
funny how it seems like yesterday
as i recall you were looking out of place
gathered up your things and slipped away
no time at all i followed you into the hall
cigarette daydream
you were only seventeen
so sweet with a mean streak
nearly brought me to my knees
do do do do do do
you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wanna find peace of mind
looking for the answer
if we can find a reason a reason to change
looking for the answer
if you can find a reason a reason to stay
standing in the pouring rain
do do do do do
do do do do do do do
do do do do do
do do do do do do do
you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wanna find peace of mind
looking for the answer
if we can find a reason a reason to change
looking for the answer
if you can find a reason a reason to stay
standing in the pouring rain
in a far and distant galaxy
inside my telescope i see
a pair of eyes peer back at me
he walks and talks and looks like me
sits around inside his house
from room to room he moves about
fills his life with pointless things
and wonders how it all turns out
do do do do do
do do do do do
it's safe to say that
i don't think you understand
there's nowhere left to turn
walls keep breaking
time is like a leaf in the wind
either it's time well spent
or time i've wasted don't waste it
afraid of what the truth might bring
he locks his doors and never leaves
desperately searching for signs
too terrified to find a thing
he battens all the hatches down
and wonders why he hears no sounds
frantically searching his dreams
he wonders what it's all about
do do do do do
do do do do do
it's safe to say that
i don't think you understand
there's nowhere left to turn
walls keep breaking
time is like a leaf in the wind
either it's time well spent
or time i've wasted
here in my mind losing my friends
fall on my face do it again
you say how do you do
man how 'bout you man how 'bout you
to be free to be sold
to be killed to be saved
in my head i'm alone
i'm not dead i'm ashamed
just like you i've been tryin'
to escape in my bones
i feel cold i give thanks
to the lord industry
in this street let me go
let me be i don't need
to be here i'm alone
can't you see can't you see
i don't think you understand
there's nowhere left to turn
walls keep breaking
time is like a leaf in the wind
either it's time well spent
or time i've wasted don't waste it
oooooooooooooo

life's alright in devil town
they're right no one's gonna catch us now
dad has bought a new car now
we're fine no one's gonna catch us now
you said something dumb again
she's mad at least that's what they say
mum and daddy aren't in love
that's fine i'll settle for two birthdays
devil town is colder in the summertime
i'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
hold my hand tight we'll make it another night
i still get a little scared of something new
but i feel a little safer when i'm with you
falling doesn't feel so bad when i know you've fallen this way too
we're all dead in devil town
that's fine cause nothing's gonna scare us now
we're all in our dressing gowns mine's white
and stripey yours is green and brown
i forgot my name again
i think that's something worth remembering
spiders in your favourite shoes
just leave them be cause they're more scared of you
devil town is colder in the summertime
i'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
hold my hand tight we'll make it another night
i still get a little scared of something new
but i feel a little safer when i'm with you
falling doesn't feel so bad when i know you've fallen this way too
devil town is colder in the summertime
i'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
hold my hand tight we'll make it another night
but i feel a little safer when i'm with you
falling doesn't feel so bad when i know you've fallen this way too
i am just a fool to keep on chasing after nothing great
you are just a fool to keep pretending that you're loving me
i don't know where i'm supposed to go
oh oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh oh oh oh ooh oh
call me on the phone at three i talk to you while half asleep
complaining 'bout your mother so i take you to the cemetery
rant to me i like the sound i like your voice i like your mouth
oh ooh mmmmm
ahahahahah
cycling to school at in the morning
i am still your baby boy i’m stuck in
don’t understand my body washing machine confuses me
oh oooohoo mmmmmm
i am such a fool to keep on chasing after nothing great
you are such a fool to keep pretending that you're loving me
i don't know where i'm supposed to goohoh
oh oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh oh ooh oh
i was such a fool to keep on chasing after nothing great
you were such a fool to keep pretending that you’re loving me
look in the mirror i love that boy don’t hurt my dear don’t hurt my joy
oh ohoh ooh oh oh oh ooh oh
oy ooy oyoh oy oy oyyoyo
often i am upset that i cannot fall in love but i guess
this avoids the stress of falling out of it
are you tired of me yet i'm a little sick right now but i swear
when i'm ready i will fly us out of here
ooooo i'll cut my hair
ooooo to make you stare
ooooo i'll hide my chest
and i'll figure out a way to get us out of here
ooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo
turn off your porcelain face i can't really think right now and this place
has too many colours enough to drive all of us insane
are you dead sometimes i think i'm dead
cause i can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
but i don't wanna fall asleep just yet
ooooo my eyes went dark
ooooo i don't know where
ooooo my pupils are
but i'll figure out a way to get us out of here
get a load of this monster
he doesn't know how to communicate
his mind is in a different place
will everybody please give him a little bit of space
get a load of this trainwreck
his hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
welcome him with open arms
ooooo time is
ooooo slowly
ooooo tracing his face
but strangely he feels at home in this place
i need to cry
but i can't get anything out of my eyes
or my head did i die
i need to run
but i can't get out of bed for anyone
not for you hun
my sour boy is a pain
i wanna shoot him in the brain
but i'd miss him in the morning
it really hurts
when i need to so bad but i can't see her
my juliet my special girl
but i need to understand
when i can power through
and when i need some help from you
when i should stand my ground
and when i need to just sit down
sometimes i act like i know
but i'm really just a kid
with two corks in his eyes
and a bully in his head
i wanna make
a colour that no one else has seen before
i wanna be so much more
i hope that she
looks at me and thinks shit he's so pretty
something i can't believe
but i need to understand
when i can power through
and when i need some help from you
when i should stand my ground
and when i need to just sit down
sometimes i act like i know
but i'm really just a kid
with two corks in his eyes
and a bully in his head
sometimes i act like i know but i'm really just a kid
with two corks in his eyes and a bully in his head
sometimes i act like i know but i'm really just a kid
with two corks in his eyes and a bully in his head
there once was a bittersweet man and they called him lemon boy
he was growing in my garden and i pulled him out by his hair like a weed
and like weeds do he only came and grew back again
so i figured this time i might as well let him be
lemon boy and me started to get along together
i helped him plant his seeds and we mow the lawn in bad weather
it's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
so i got myself a citrus friend
but soon his bittersweet started to rub off on me
you'd think smelling like lemon zest would be pretty neat
i found out that my friends were more of the savory type
and they weren't too keen with compromising with a nice lemon pie
so lemon boy and me started to get along together
i helped him plant his seeds and we mow the lawn in bad weather
it's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
so i got myself a citrus friend
but what if i run out of fertilizer
what if the clouds run out of rain
what if lemon boy won't grow no longer
what if beaches dry of sugar cane ohoh well
whales start to beach themselves
tortoise shells tear away from their spines
it happens all the time
it happens all the time
so lemon boy and i we're gonna live forever
like snufkin and little my we'll get around wherever
lemon boy and i we're gonna live forever
like snufkin and little my we'll get around wherever
it's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
cause we're the bitterest boys in town
yeah we're the bitterest guys around
and i've got myself a citrus friend
i've got miles of regrets and confusing friends
but perhaps it's just my stupid head in the end
thinking should i wait here or make my way home
you said go you said go
making up problems that don't exist
why do i let myself dream like this
we're floating away my body's in space
we are going home
missing pieces of my skull
i'll sew on patches of my own soul
there's nothing you or i can do so let the stars fall
cause from up here the sky's my thoughts and we're all so
small
meteor shower quick take cover
but the hues in our hair compliment one another
i'd sell my own bones for sapphire stones
cause blue's your favourite colour
missing pieces of my skull
i'll sew on patches of my own soul
there's nothing you or i can do so let the stars fall
cause from up here the sky's my thoughts and we're all so
small
we're all so
my heart and the earth share the same rule
it starts with love and it ends with u
but don't go outside it's dangerous tonight
without me right here by your side
take it slow you'll know
which way to go
take your time
and we'll be just
fine
missing pieces of my skull
i'll sew on patches of my own soul
i tried for you
tried to see through all the smoke and dirt
it wouldn't move
what could i do
i touch your head
to pull your thoughts
but now i can't
say isn't it strange
isn't it strange
i am still me
you are still you
in the same place
isn't it strange
how people can change
from strangers to friends
friends into lovers
to strangers again
back to this room
back to our roots
what did we lose
what did we lose
if i could i'd pull your strings for one more dance
but i can't
say isn't it strange
isn't it strange
you look at me
i look at you
with nothing to say
isn't it strange
how people can change
from strangers to friends
friends into lovers
and strangers again
i'm only one call away
i'll be there to save the day
superman got nothing on me

superman got nothing on me
i'm only one call away
i'm only one call away
oh so your weak rhyme
you doubt i'll bother reading into it
i probably won't
left to my own devices
but that's the difference in our opinions
you're a mouthful
that amounts for another week on my own
now i'm a novel made resourceful
i start a chain with my thought
talk is cheap my darling
when you're feeling right at home
i wanna make you move with confidence
i wanna be with you alone
said help me help you start it
you're too comfortable to know
throwing out those words
oh you gotta feel it on your own
cold pain
i cannot sustain it
that's what i'm thinking
not what i'm drinking
i hold up my ways
these thoughts are pervasive
it's not a statement
but peace can be evasive
you're a mouthful
that amounts for another week on my own
now i'm a novel made resourceful
i start a chain with my thought
talk is cheap my darling

loving and fighting
accusing denying
i can't imagine a world with you gone
the joy and the chaos the demons we're made of
i'd be so lost if you left me alone
you locked yourself in the bathroom
lying on the floor when i break through
i pull you in to feel your heartbeat
can you hear me screaming "please don't leave me"
hold on i still want you
come back i still need you
let me take your hand i'll make it right
i swear to love you all my life
hold on i still need you
a long endless highway you're silent beside me
drivin' a nightmare i can't escape from
helplessly praying the light isn't fadin'
hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
they took you away on a table
i pace back and forth as you lay still
i pull you in to feel your heartbeat
can you hear me screaming "please don't leave me"
hold on i still want you
come back i still need you
let me take your hand i'll make it right
i swear to love you all my life
hold on i still need you
i don't wanna let go
i know i'm not that strong
i just wanna hear you
saying baby let's go home
let's go home
yeah i just wanna take you home
hold on i still want you
come back i still need you
on a cobwebbed afternoon
in a room full of emptiness
by a freeway i confess
i was lost in the pages
of a book full of death
reading how we'll die alone
and if we're good we'll lay to rest
anywhere we want to go
in your house i long to be
room by room patiently
i'll wait for you there
like a stone i'll wait for you there
alone
and on my deathbed
i will pray
to the gods and the angels
like a pagan to anyone
who will take me to heaven
to a place i recall
i was there so long ago
the sky was bruised
the wine was bled
and there you led me on
in your house i long to be
room by room patiently
i'll wait for you there
like a stone i'll wait for you there
aloooone aloooone
and on i read
until the day was gone
and i sat in regret
of all the things i've done
for all that i've blessed
and all that i've wronged
in dreams until my death
i will wander on
in your house i long to be
room by room patiently
i'll wait for you there
like a stone i'll wait for you there
aloooone aloooooooone
it's been seven hours and fifteen days
since you took your love away
i go out all night and sleep all day
since you took your love away
since you've been gone i can do whatever i want
i can see whoever i choose
i can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant but nothing
nothing can take away these blues
'cause nothing compares
nothing compares to you
it's been so lonely without you here
like a bird without a song
nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
tell me baby where did i go wrong
i could put my arms around every girl i see
but they'd only remind me of you
went to the doctor guess what he told me guess what he told me
he said boy you better try to have fun
no matter what you do
'cause nothing compares
nothing compares to you
all the flowers that you planted momma in the backyard
all died when you went away
i know that living with me baby was sometimes hard
but i'm willing to give it another try
'cause nothing compares
nothing compares to you
'cause nothing compares
nothing compares to you
to you
seen my share of broken halos
folded wings that used to fly
they've all gone wherever they go
broken halos that used to shine
angels come down from the heavens
just to help us on our way
come to teach us then they leave us
and they find some other soul to save
seen my share of broken halos
folded wings that used to fly
they've all gone wherever they go
broken halos that used to shine
broken halos that used to shine
don't go lookin' for the reasons
don't go askin' jesus why
we're not meant to know the answers
they belong to the by and by
they belong to the by and by
seen my share of broken halos
folded wings that used to fly
they've all gone wherever they go
broken halos that used to shine
broken halos that used to shine
broken halos that used to shine
broken halos that used to shine
broken halos that used to shine
honey load up your questions
and pick up your sticks and your stones
and pretend i'm a shelter

you’re as sweeeeet as strawberry wine
you’re as warm as a glass of brandy
and honey i stay stoned on your love all the time
e
i’ve looked for love in all the same old places
found the bottom of a bottle was always dry
e

darling don't be afraid i have loved you
for a thousand years
i love you for a thousand more
and all along i believed i would find you
time has brought your heart to me
i have loved you for a thousand years
i love you for a thousand more
slowly strumming or finger picking
i can hold my breath
i can bite my tongue
i can stay awake for days
if that’s what you want
be your number one
i can fake a smile
i can force a laugh
i can dance and play the part
if that’s what you ask
give you all i am
i can do it
but i’m only human
and i bleed when i fall down
i’m only human
and i crash and i break down
your words in my head knives in my heart
you build me up and then i fall apart cause i’m only
human
i can turn it on
be a good machine
i can hold the weight of worlds
if that's what you need
be your everything
i can do it
but i’m only human
and i bleed when i fall down
i’m only human
and i crash and i break down
your words in my head knives in my heart
you build me up and then i fall apart cause i’m only
human
i’m only human
i can take so much
till i’ve had enough
cause i’m only human
and i bleed when i fall down
i’m only human
and i crash and i break down
your words in my head knives in my heart
you build me up and then i fall apart cause i’m only
human
i know i can't take one more step towards you
'cause all thats waiting is regret
and don't you know i'm not your ghost anymore
you lost the love i loved the most
i learned to live half a life
and now you want me one more time
and who do you think you are
running 'round leaving scars
collecting your jar of hearts
tearing love apart
you're gonna catch a cold
from the ice inside your soul
don't come back for me
who do you think you are
i hear you're asking all around
if i am anywhere to be found
but i have grown too strong
to ever fall back in your arms
i learned to live half a life
and now you want me one more time
and who do you think you are
running 'round leaving scars
collecting your jar of hearts
tearing love apart
you're gonna catch a cold
from the ice inside your soul
don't come back for me
who do you think you are
it took so long just to feel alright
remember how to put back the light in my eyes
i wish i had missed the first time that we kissed
'cause you broke all your promises
and now you're back
you don't get to get me back
who do you think you are
running 'round leaving scars
collecting your jar of hearts
and tearing love apart
you're gonna catch a cold
from the ice inside your soul
so don't come back for me
don't come back at all
and who do you think you are
running 'round leaving scars
collecting your jar of hearts
tearing love apart
you're gonna catch a cold
from the ice inside your soul
don't come back for me
don't come back at all
who do you think you are
who do you think you are
who do you think you are
you leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

i remember when i first noticed that you liked me back
we were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
we had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
but i could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
kristen come right back
i've been waiting for you
to sleep back in bed
when you light the candle
and on the lower east side you're dancing with me now
and i'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
think i like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
think i like you best when you're just with me and no one else
kristen come right back
i've been waiting for you
to sleep back in bed
when you light the candle
and i'm kissing you lying in my room
holding you until you fall asleep
and it's just as good as i knew it would be

kristen come right back

to sleep back in bed
when you light the candle
every second counts i don't wanna talk to you anymore
all these little games you can call me by the name i gave you
yesterday yeah
every minute counts i don't wanna watch tv anymore
can you figure me out just doin this to waste more time on the couch
can you see me i'm waiting for the right time
i can't read you but if you want the pleasure's all mine
can you see me using everything to hold back
i guess this could be worse
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags
pour your glass of wine mitchell told me i should be just fine yeah
cases under the bed spill it open let it rush to my head
i don't wanna be forward i don't wanna cut corners
savor this with everything i have inside of me
i'm not the type to run i know that we're having fun
but what's the rush kiss and then my cheeks are so flushed
tell you how i felt sugar coated melting in your mouth
pardon my emotions i should probably keep it all to myself
know you'd make fun of me
know you'd make fun of me
know you'd make fun of me
know you'd make fun of me
can you see me i'm waiting for the right time
i can't read you but if you want the pleasure's all mine

i guess this could be worse
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags

sorry i didn't kiss you
but it's obvious i wanted to
bubble gum down my throat its a curse
but my luck couldnt get any worse

how you felt in my hands in my hands
i could be a pretty girl i'll wear a skirt for you
i could be a pretty girl shut up when you want me to
i could be a pretty girl won't ever make you blue
i could be a pretty girl i'll lose myself in you
i was so blinded by you now i cry
just thinking 'bout the fool that i was

christmas night another fight
tears we cried a flood
got all kinds of poison in
of poison in my blood
i took my feet to oxford street
trying to right a wrong
just walk away those windows say
but i can't believe she's gone
when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
doesn't really feel like christmas at all
a group of candles on air flicker
oh they flicker and they float
but i'm up here holding on
to all those chandeliers of hope
like some drunken elvis singing
i go singing out of tune
saying how i always loved you darling
and i always will
oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
doesn't really feel like christmas at all
still waiting for the snow to fall
it doesn't really feel like christmas at all
those christmas lights
down where the sea and city meet
may all your troubles soon be gone
oh christmas lights keep shining on
those christmas lights
maybe they'll bring her back to me
then all my troubles will be gone
oh christmas lights keep shining on
wohohohohohohohohohohoh
oh christmas lights
light up the fireworks in me
may all your troubles soon be gone
oh christmas lights keep shining on
oh they say people come
they say people go
this particular diamond was extra special
and though you might be gone
and the world may not know
still i see you celestial
like a lion you ran
a goddess you rolled
like an eagle you circled
in perfect purple
so how come things move on
how come cars don’t slow
when it feels like the end of my world
when i should but i can’t let you go
but when i’m cold cold
when i’m cold cold
there’s a light that you give me
when i’m in shadow
there’s a feeling you give me an everglow
like brothers in blood
sisters who ride
and we swore on that night
we’d be friends ‘til we die
but the changing of winds
and the way waters flow
life is short as the falling of snow
and now i’m gonna miss you i know
when i’m cold cold
in water rolled salt
i know that you’re always with me
and the way you will show and you’re with me wherever i go
and you give me this feeling this everglow
what i wouldn’t give for just a moment to know
yeah i live for this feeling this everglow
so if you love someone you should let them know
oh the light that you give me will everglow
ohhhhh angels sent from up above
you know you make my world light up
when i was down
when i was hurt
you came to lift me up
life is a drink and love's a drug
oh now i think i must be miles up
when i was a river dried up
you came to rain a flood
so drink from me drink from me
when i was so thirsty
pour on a symphony
now i just can't get enough
put your wings on me wings on me
when i was so heavy
pour on a symphony
when i'm lower lower lower low

when she was just a girl
she expected the world
but it flew away from her reach
so she ran away in her sleep
dreamed of paraparaparadise
paraparaparadise
paraparaparadise
every time she closed her eyes
but it flew away from her reach
and bullets catch in her teeth
life goes on
it gets so heavy
the wheel breaks the butterfly
every tear a waterfall
in the night the stormy night
she closed her eyes
in the night the stormy night
away she flied
and dreamed of paraparaparadise
paraparaparadise
paraparaparadise
whoaohoh ohoooh ohohoh

my grandpa taught me about buck knifes and shot guns
and how to cast an old zebco and how to work a stick shift
he taught me the bible about all disciples
and he made sure that i know there’s life after this
with pearly gates and streets of gold
he said if i just believe that’s where i’ll go
lord when i die i wanna live on the outskirts of heaven
where there’s dirt roads for miles and hay in the fields and fish in the river
where there’s dogwood trees and honey bees and blue skies and green grass forever
so lord when i die i wanna live on the outskirts of heaven
now it says in the king james in the almightys kingdom
he mentions a mansion that he’s built just for me
now i’d gladly trade it for a farm house with acreage
and a back yard that’s shaded and a squeaky front porch swing
that’s where i wanna hang my wings
when i die i wanna live on the outskirts of heaven
where there’s dirt roads for miles and hay in the fields and fish in the river
where there’s dogwood trees and honey bees and blue skies and green grass forever
so lord when i die i wanna live on the outskirts of heaven yes i do
yeah the good lord knows me he knows i need blue skies and green grass forever
lord when i die i wanna live on the outskirts of heaven
yeah when i die i wanna live on the outskirts of heaven

christmas time is here
happiness and cheer
fun for all that children call
their favorite time of year
snowflakes in the air
carols everywhere
olden times and ancient rhymes
of love and dreams to share
sleigh bells in the air
beauty everywhere
yuletide by the fireside
and joyful memories there
christmas time is here
we'll be drawing near
oh that we could always see
such spirit through the year
sleigh bells in the air
beauty everywhere
yuletide by the fireside
and joyful memories there
christmas time is here
we'll be drawing near
oh that we could always see
such spirit through the year
such spirit through the year
have yourself a merry little christmas
let your heart be light
from now on our troubles will be out of sight
have yourself a merry little christmas
make the yuletide gay
from now on our troubles will be miles away
here were are as in olden days
happy golden days of yore
faithful friends who are dear to us
gather near to us once more
through the years we all will be together
if the fates allow
hang a shining star upon the highest bough
and have yourself a merry little christmas
have yourself a merry little christmas
and have yourself a merry little christmas now
hold me close and hold me fast
this magic spell you cast
this is la vie en rose
when you kiss me heaven sighs
and though i close my eyes
i see la vie en rose
when you press me to your heart
i'm in a world apart
a world where roses bloom
and when you speak angels sing from above
everyday words seem
to turn into love songs
give your heart and soul to me
and life will always be
la vie en rose
and when you speak angels sing from above
everyday words seem
to turn into love songs
give your heart and soul to me
and life will always be
la vie en rose

shadows settle on the place that you left
our minds are troubled by the emptiness
destroy the middle it's a waste of time
from the perfect start to the finish line
and if you're still breathing you're the lucky ones
'cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
setting fire to our insides for fun
collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
the lovers that went wrong
we are the reckless we are the wild youth
chasing visions of our futures
one day we'll reveal the truth
that one will die before he gets there
and if you're still bleeding you're the lucky ones
'cause most of our feelings they are dead and they are gone
we're setting fire to our insides for fun
collecting pictures from the flood that wrecked our home
it was a flood that wrecked this
and you caused it
and you caused it
and you caused it
well i've lost it all i'm just a silhouette
a lifeless face that you'll soon forget
my eyes are damp from the words you left
ringing in my head when you broke my chest
ringing in my head when you broke my chest
and if you're in love then you are the lucky one
'cause most of us are bitter over someone
setting fire to our insides for fun
to distract our hearts from ever missing them
but i'm forever missing him
and you caused it
and you caused it
and you caused it
you shout it out
but i can't hear a word you say
i'm talking loud not saying much
i'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
you shoot me down but i get up
i'm bulletproof nothing to lose
fire away fire away
ricochet you take your aim
fire away fire away
you shoot me down but i won't fall
i am tita ni um
you shoot me down but i won't fall
i am tita ni um
cut me down
but it's you who'll have further to fall
ghost town haunted love
raise your voice sticks and stones may break my bones
i'm talking loud not saying much
i'm bulletproof nothing to lose
fire away fire away
ricochet you take your aim
fire away fire away
you shoot me down but i won't fall
i am tita ni um
you shoot me down but i won't fall
i am tita ni um
i am tita ni um
i am tita ni um
stonehard machine gun
firing at the ones who run
stone hard as bulletproof glass
you shoot me down but i won't fall
i am tita ni um
you shoot me down but i won't fall
i am tita ni um
you shoot me down but i won't fall
i am tita ni um
you shoot me down but i won't fall
i am tita ni um
i am tita ni um
i feel close
well maybe im not heaven knows
its a spotlight stuck on the ceiling
why are these the things that im feeling
theres so much time
for me to speak up but i keep quiet
ill complicate the most of the mantra
the power's out and i cant turn the fan on
so can i call you tonight
im trying to make up my mind
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real
i hear your voice on the phone
now im no longer alone
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real anymore
voice so low
sneaking around so it goes
i always try my best to listen
picking up things that i can fidget
circle speed
pacing around watching my feet
batteries drain i get the memo
i think that i might have to let you go
so can i call you tonight
im trying to make up my mind
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real
i hear your voice on the phone
now im no longer alone
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real anymore
dont go dont go so easy
dont go dont go and leave me
dont go dont go so easy
dont go dont go and leave me
dont go dont go so easy
dont go dont go and leave me
dont go dont go so easy
dont go dont go and leave me
so can i call you tonight
im trying to make up my mind
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real
i hear your voice on the phone
now im no longer alone
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real anymore
i look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
you look away from me and i see there's something you're trying to hide
and i reach for your hand but it's cold you pull away again
and i wonder what's on your mind
and then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
you start to tremble and your voice begins to break
you say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend’s they were my mate’s
and i feel the colour draining from my face
"i know you love her but it's over mate
it doesn't matter put the phone away
it's never easy to walk away
let her go oh oh oh
so i asked to look back at all the messages you'd sent
and i know it wasn't right but it was fucking with my head
and everything deleted like the past yea it was gone
and when i touched your face i could tell you're moving on
but it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
it's the feeling of betrayal that i just can't seem to shake
and everything i know tells me that i should walk away
but i just want to stay
"i know you love her but it's over mate
it doesn't matter put the phone away
it's never easy to walk away
let her go oh oh oh
it's gonna hurt for a bit of time
so bottoms up let's forget tonight
you'll find another and you'll be just fine
let her go oh oh oh
but nothing heals
the past like time
and they can't steal
the love you're born to find
but nothing heals
the past like time
and they can't steal
the love you're born to find
"i know you love her but it's over mate
it doesn't matter put the phone away
it's never easy to walk away
let her go oh oh oh
it's gonna hurt for a bit of time
so bottoms up let's forget tonight
you'll find another and you'll be just fine
let her go oh oh oh"
it’ll be alright
it’ll be alright
it’ll be alright
it’ll be alright
it’ll be alright
there is a swelling storm
and i'm caught up in the middle of it all
and it takes control of the person that i thought i was
the boy i used to know
there is a light in the dark
and i feel its warmth
in my hands in my heart
why can't i hold on
it comes and goes in waves
it always does it always does
we watch as our young hearts fade
into the flood into the flood
freedom falling
the feeling that i thought was set in stone
slips through my fingers
trying hard to let go
it comes and goes in waves
it comes and goes in waves
it carries us away
through the wind
down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
memories of a stolen place
caught in the silence an echo lost in space
it comes and goes in waves
it always does it always does
we watch as our young hearts fade
into the flood into the flood
freedom falling
the feeling that i thought was set in stone
slips through my fingers
trying hard to let go
it comes and goes in waves
it comes and goes in waves
it carries us away
i watched my wild youth disappear in front of my eyes
moments of magic and wonder
seems so hard to find
is it coming back again
is it ever coming back again
take me back to the feeling when
everything was left to find
it comes and goes in waves
it always does it always does
freedom falling
the feeling that i thought was set in stone
slips through my fingers
trying hard to let go
it comes and goes in waves
it comes and goes in waves

ich wart seit wochen auf diesen tag
und tanz vor freude über den asphalt
als wär's ein rythmus als gäb's ein lied
das mich immer weiter durch die straßen zieht
komm dir entgegen dich abzuholen wie ausgemacht
zu der selben uhrzeit am selben treffpunkt wie letztes mal
durch das gedränge der menschenmenge
bahnen wir uns den altbekannten weg
entlang der gassen zu den rheinterrassen
über die brücken bis hin zu der musik
wo alles laut ist wo alle drauf sind um durchzudreh'n
wo die anderen warten um mit uns zu starten und abzugeh'n
an tagen wie diesen wünscht man sich unendlichkeit
an tagen wie diesen haben wir noch ewig zeit
wünsch ich mir unendlichkeit
das hier ist ewig ewig für heute
wir steh'n nicht still für eine ganze nacht
komm ich trag dich durch die leute
hab keine angst ich gebe auf dich acht
wir lassen uns treiben tauchen unter schwimmen mit dem strom
dreh'n unsere kreise kommen nicht mehr runter sind schwerelos
an tagen wie diesen wünscht man sich unendlichkeit
an tagen wie diesen haben wir noch ewig zeit
in dieser nacht der nächte die uns so viel verspricht
erleben wir das beste kein ende ist in sicht
kein ende in sicht
kein ende in sicht
kein ende in sicht fadebase pond
an tagen wie diesen wünscht man sich unendlichkeit
an tagen wie diesen haben wir noch ewig zeit
in dieser nacht der nächte die uns so viel verspricht
erleben wir das beste kein ende ist in sicht
erleben wir das beste und kein ende in sicht
kein ende in sicht

hello darkness my old friend
i've come to talk with you again
because a vision softly creeping
left its seeds while i was sleeping
and the vision that was planted in my brain
still remains within the sound of silence
in restless dreams i walked alone
narrow streets of cobblestone
'neath the halo of a street lamp
i turned my collar to the cold and damp
when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
that split the night
and touched the sound of silence
and in the naked light i saw
ten thousand people maybe more
people talking without speaking
people hearing without listening
people writing songs that voices never share
and no one dare
disturb the sound of silence
fools said i you do not know
silence like a cancer grows
hear my words that i might teach you
take my arms that i might reach you
but my words like silent raindrops fell
and echoed in the wells of silence
and the people bowed and prayed
to the neon god they made
and the sign flashed out it's warning
and the words that it was forming
the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
and tenement halls
and whispered in the sound of silence
am i allowed to look at her like that
could it be wrong when she's just so nice to look at
and she smells like lemongrass and sleep
she tastes like apple juice and peach
you would find her in a polaroid picture
and she means everything to me
i'd never tell
no i'd never say a word
and oh it aches
but it feels oddly good to hurt
and she smells like lemongrass and sleep
she tastes like apple juice and peach
you would find her in a polaroid picture
and she means everything to me
and i'll be okay
admiring from afar
cause even when she's next to me
we could not be more far apart
cause she tastes like birthday cake and storytime and fall
but to her
i taste of nothing at all
and she smells like lemongrass and sleep
she tastes like apple juice and peach
you would find her in a polaroid picture
and she means everything to me
yes she means everything to me
she means everything to me
e||
where'd all the time go
it's starting to fly
see how the hands go
waving goodbye
and you know i get so forgetful
when i look in your eyes
now she's walking backwards
through a parade
and i'm stuck in the shadow
blocking the shade
and there ain't no way to sweep up the
mess that we've made
she gets dressed up like a pillow so she's
always in bed
flowers for the sick and dead
she's on the go way too fast and way too slow
she'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes
and when the fog rises somebody sighs
who is not in disguise anymore
there's nothing to keep you
from falling in love
it starts at the bottom
and comes from above
like pieces of a puzzle like a hand in a glove
she gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed
flowers for the sick and dead
she's on the go way too fast and way too slow
she'll turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes
and when the tide rises somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye

the pictures tell the story
this life has many shades
i’d wake up every morning and before i’d start each day
i’d take a drag from last nights cigarette
that smoldered in it’s tray
down a little something and then be on my way
i traveled far and wide
and laid this head in many ports
i was guided by a compass
i saw beauty to the north
i drew the tales of many lives
and wore the faces of my own
i had these memories all around me
so i wouldn’t be alone
some may be from showing up
others are from growing up
sometimes i was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
i ain’t winning no one over
i wear it just for you
i’ve got your name written here
in a rose tattoo
in a rose tattoo
i’ve got your name written here
in a rose tattoo

this ones for the mighty sea
mischief gold and piracy
this ones for the man that raised me
taught me sacrifice and bravery
this ones for our favorite game
black and gold we wave the flag
this ones for my family name
with pride i wear it to the grave
some may be from showing up
others are from growing up
sometimes i was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
i ain't winning no one over
i wear it just for you
i’ve got your name written here
in a rose tattoo
in a rose tattoo
in a rose tattoo
i’ve got your name written here

in a rose tattoo
in a rose tattoo
i’ve got your name written here
in a rose tattoo
this one means the most to me
stays here for eternity
a ship that always stays the course
an anchor for my every choice
a rose that shines down from above
i signed and sealed these words in blood
i heard them once sung in a song
it played again and we sang along
you’ll always be there with me
even if you’re gone
you’ll always have my love
our memory will live on
some may be from showing up
others are from growing up
sometimes i was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
i ain't winning no one over
i wear it just for you
i’ve got your name written here
in a rose tattoo

i’ve got your name written here

with pride i’ll wear it to the grave for you

signed and sealed in blood i would die for you
oohoohooh oohooh oohooh
oohoohooh oohooh oohooh
a broken heart is all that's left
i'm still fixing all the cracks
lost a couple of pieces when
i carried it carried it carried it home
i'm afraid of all i am
my mind feels like a foreign land
silence ringing inside my head
please carry me carry me carry me home
i spent all of the love i've saved
we were always a losing game
smalltown boy in a big arcade
i got addicted to a losing game
ooh ooh
all i know all i know
loving you is a losing game
how many pennies in the slot
giving us up didn't take a lot
i saw the end 'fore it begun
still i carried i carried i carry on
ooh ooh
all i know all i know
loving you is a losing game
ooh ooh
all i know all i know
loving you is a losing game
i don't need your games game over
get me off this rollercoaster
ooh ooh
all i know all i know
loving you is a losing game
oohoohooh oohooh oohooh
oohoohooh oohooh oohooh
ya dime si quieres estar conmigo o si mejor me voy
tus besos dicen que tu si me quieres pero tus palabras no
y al chile yo hasta moriría por ti pero dices que no
no eres directa neta ya me estás cansando sé concreta por favor
y en la noche que las estrellas salen yo pienso en ti mi amor
que me hiciste de mi cabeza no sales
y no lo digo por mamon
si me dices para ti qué soy no dudaré en hacerte tan feliz
eres especial para mi
dime por qué me haces sufrir
yo te olvidaré desde las fuentes de ortiz
soy inseguro cuando dices que me quieres porque creo que no
como bebé caigo pero sí redondito en tu trampa amor
ya dime si tu me quieres por favor
y he sufrido y me he empedado tanto por tu amor
y en la noche en que las estrellas salen
yo pienso en ti mi amor
qué me hiciste de mi cabeza no sales
y no lo digo por mamon
si me dices para ti quién soy
no durare en hacerte tan feliz eres especial para mi
dime por qué me haces sufrir
yo te olvidaré desde las fuentes de ortiz
when i was six years old i broke my leg
and i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as i rolled down
i was younger then take me back to when i
found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and i've not seen the roaring fields in so long i know i've grown
but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way driving at ninety
down those country lanes singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old and smoking handrolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night i don't reckon i did it
right i was younger then take me back to when we found
weekend jobs and when we got paid
we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long oh how we've grown
but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way driving at ninety
down those country lanes singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone one's brother overdosed
one's already on his second wife one's just barely getting by but
these people raised me and iii can't wait to go home
and i'm on my way i still remember
these old country lanes when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill

well maybe i came on too strong
maybe i waited too long
maybe i played my cards wrong oh just a little bit wrong
baby i apologize for it
i could fall or i could fly
here in your aeroplane
and i could live i could die
hanging on the words you say
and i’ve been known to give my all
and jumping in harder than
ten thousand rocks on the lake
so don’t call me baby
unless you mean it
and don’t tell me you need me
if you don’t believe it
so let me know the truth
before i dive right into you
you’re a mystery
i have travelled the world and there’s no other girl like you no one
what’s your history
do you have a tendency to lead some people on
‘cause i heard you do mmmmmm
i could fall or i could fly
here in your aeroplane
and i could live i could die
hanging on the words you say
and i’ve been known to give my all

loving can hurt
loving can hurt sometimes
but it's the only thing that i know
when it gets hard
you know it can get hard sometimes
it is the only thing that makes us feel alive
we keep this love in a photograph
we make these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closing
our hearts were never broken
and times forever frozen still
so you can keep me inside the pocket of your
ripped jeans holding me closer till our
eyes meet you won't ever be alone
wait for me to come home
loving can heal
loving can mend your soul
and it's the only thing that i know
i swear it will get easier
remember that with every piece of ya
it is the only thing we take with us when we die
we keep this love in a photograph

where our eyes are never closing
our hearts were never broken
and times forever frozen still
so you can keep me inside the pocket of your
ripped jeans holding me closer till our
eyes meet you won't ever be alone
and if you hurt me that's okay baby only
words bleed inside these pages you just
hold me and i won't ever let you go
wait for me to come home

next to your heartbeat where i
should be keep it deep within your soul
and if you hurt me that's okay baby only
words bleed inside these pages you just
hold me and i won't ever let you go
when i'm away i will remember how you
kissed me under the lamp post back on sixth street
hearing you whisper through the phone

i took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
i threw the day old tea from the cup
packed up the photo album matthew had made
memories of a life that’s been loved
took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
poured the old ginger beer down the sink
dad always told me don’t you cry when you’re down
but mum there’s a tear every time that i blink
oh i’m in pieces it’s tearing me up but i know
a heart that’s broke is a heart that’s been loved
so i’ll sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down you’d be there
holding me up spread your wings as you go
and when god takes you back he’ll say hallelujah you’re home
i fluffed the pillows made the beds stacked the chairs up
folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
john said he’d drive then put his hand on my cheek
and wiped a tear from the side of my face
and i hope that i see the world as you did cause i know
a life with love is a life that’s been lived
so i’ll sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down you’d be there
holding me up spread your wings as you go
and when god takes you back he’ll say hallelujah you’re home
ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh
hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
you got to see the person i have become spread your wings and i know that when
god took you back he said hallelujah you’re home
you look so wonderful in your dress
i love your hair like that
the way it falls on the side of your neck
down your shoulders and back
we are surrounded by all of these lies
and people who talk too much
you've got that kind of look in your eyes
as if no one knows anything but us
and should this be the last thing i see
i want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need
i'm so in love
so in love
so in love
so in love
you look so beautiful in this light
your silhouette over me
the way it brings out the blue in your eyes
is the tenerife sea
and all of the voices surrounding us here
they just fade out when you take a breath
just say the word and i will disappear
into the wilderness
and should this be the last thing i see
i want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need
i'm so in love
so in love
so in love
so in love
lumière darling
lumière over me
lumière darling
lumière over me
lumière darling
lumière over me
should this be the last thing i see
i want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need
i'm so in love
so in love
so in love
so in love
you looked so wonderful in your dress
i loved your hair like that
and in the moment i knew you beth
white lips pale face
breathing in snowflakes
burnt lungs sour taste
light's gone day's end
struggling to pay rent
long nights strange men
and they say
she's in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since
but lately her face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries
the worst things in life come free to us
cos we're just under the upperhand
and go mad for a couple grams
and she don't want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
it's too cold outside
for angels to fly
angels to fly
ripped gloves raincoat
tried to swim and stay afloat
dry house wet clothes
loose change bank notes
wearyeyed dry throat
call girl no phone
and they say
she's in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since
but lately her face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries
the worst things in life come free to us
cos we're just under the upperhand
and go mad for a couple grams
and she don't want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
it's too cold outside
for angels to fly
an angel will die
covered in white
and hoping for a better life
this time we'll fade out tonight
straight down the line
and they say
she's in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since
but lately her face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries
the worst things in life come free to us
cos we're all under the upperhand
and go mad for a couple grams
and we don't want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe we fly to the motherland
or sell love to another man
it's too cold outside
for angels to fly
angels to fly
to fly fly
angels to fly to fly to fly
angels to die
when your legs don't work like they used to before
and i can't sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
and darling i will be loving you till we're
and baby my heart could still fall as hard at

people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand
well me i fall in love with you every single day
and i just wanna tell you i am
so honey now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are
and when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
and the crowds don't remember my name
when my hands don't play the strings the same way
i know you will still love me the same
cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
and baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
i'm thinking 'bout how
people fall in love in mysterious ways
and maybe it's all part of a plan
well i'll just keep on making the same mistakes
hoping that you'll understand
that baby now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
that maybe we found love right where we are
so baby now
take me into your loving arms

place your head on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
that maybe we found love right where we are

i know i know you belong
to somebody new
but tonight
you belong to me
although although we're apart
you're a part of my heart

you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feeling yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
you swore you'd never hit 'em never do nothin' to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each other's hair scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
it's the face that's the culprit it controls you both
so they say you'd best to go your separate ways
guess that they don't know ya cuz today that was yesterday
yesterday is over and it's a different day
sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
next time you'd show restraint you don't get another chance
life is no nintendo game but you lied again
guess that's why they call it "window pane"
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
now i know we said things did things that we didn't mean
and we fall back into the same patterns same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is you're the same as me
when it comes to love you're just as blinded
baby please come back it wasn't you baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time there won't be no next time
i apologize even though i know it's lies
i'm tired of the games i just want her back i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
let me go
i don't wanna be your hero
i don't wanna be a big man
just wanna fight with everyone else
your masquerade
i don't wanna be a part of your parade
everyone deserves a chance to
walk with everyone else
while holding down
a job to keep my girl around
and maybe buy me some new strings
and her a night out on the weekend
and we can whisper things
secrets from our american dreams
baby needs some protection
but i'm a kid like everyone else
so let me go
i don't wanna be your hero
i don't wanna be a big man
i just wanna fight like everyone else
ooooohh
ooooohh
so let me go
i don't wanna be your hero
i don't wanna be a big man
i just wanna fight with everyone else
your masquerade
i don't wanna be a part of your parade
everyone deserves a chance to
walk with everyone else
hey you
i'm just now leaving
can i come around later on this evening
or do you need time
yes of course that's fine
hey you
goodmorning
i'm sure you're busy now why else would you ignore me
or do you need space
you can't help it if your mind has changed
so go ahead and break my heart again
leave me wonderin' why the hell i ever let you in
are you the definition of insanity
or am i
oh it must be nice
to love someone who lets you break them twice
you're so blue
are you still breathing
won't you tell me if you found that deeper meaning
do you think i've gone blind
i know it's not the truth when you say "i'm fine"
so go ahead and break my heart again
leave me wonderin' why the hell i ever let you in
are you the definition of insanity
or am i
oh it must be nice
to love someone who lets you break them twice
don't pretend that i'm the instigator
you were the one but you were born to say goodbye
kissed me half a decade later
that same perfume those same sad eyes
go ahead and break my heart again
leave me wonderin' why the hell i ever let you in
are you the definition of insanity
or am i
or am i
it must be nice
to love someone who lets you break them twice
let's fall in love for the night
and forget in the morning

but you can have your way with me till you go
and before your kisses turn into bruises i'm a warning

cause i'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
don't waste your eyes on jealous guys fuck that noise
i know better i know better i know better than to ever call you mine
i saw the part of you
that only when you're older you will see too
you will see too
i held the better cards
but every stroke of luck has got a bleed through
it's got a bleed through
you held the balance of the time
that only blindly i could read you
but i could read you
it's like you told me
go forward slowly
it's not a race to the end
well you look like yourself
but you're somebody else
only it ain't on the surface
well you talk like yourself
no i hear someone else though
now you're making me nervous
you were the better part
of every bit of beating heart that i had
whatever i had
i finally sat alone
pitch black flesh and bone
couldn't believe that you were gone
well you look like yourself
but you're somebody else
only it ain't on the surface
well you talk like yourself
no i hear someone else though
now you're making me nervous
well you look like yourself
but you're somebody else
only it ain't on the surface

a million miles away
your signal in the distance
to whom it may concern
i think i lost my way
getting good at starting over
every time that i return
i'm learning to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin
i'm learning to talk again
can't you see i've waited long enough
where do i begin
do you remember the days
we built these paper mountains
and sat and watched them burn
i think i found my place
can't you feel it growing stronger
little conquerors
i'm learning to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin
i'm learning to talk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin
now
for the very first time
don't you pay no mind
set me free again
you keep alive a moment at a time
to sacrifice but knowing to survive
i'm on my knees i'm waiting for a sign
forever whenever
i never wanna die
i never wanna die
i'm dancing on my grave
i never wanna leave
forever whenever
forever whenever
i'm learning to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin
i'm learning to talk again
can't you see i've waited long enough
where do i begin
i'm learning to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
i'm learning to talk again
can't you see i've waited long enough

i had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you coming

if you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
we didn't give a fuck back then

my seats been taken by some sunglasses
asking 'bout a scar

it was a bad idea calling you up
was such a bad idea 'cause now i'm even more lost
it was a bad idea to think you were the one
was such a bad idea 'cause now everything's wrong
you put your hands under my shirt
undid my bra and said these words
"darling you're so pretty it hurts"
you pushed me up against my wall
threw my clothes down on the floor
"darling are you ready for more"
it was a bad idea calling you up
was such a bad idea i'm totally fucked
it was a bad idea to think i could stop
was such a bad idea i can't get enough
it was a bad idea meeting you so late
was such a bad idea 'cause i can't think straight
it was a bad idea to bring you back home
was such a bad idea i need to be alone
you put your hands under my shirt
undid my bra and said these words
"darling you're so pretty it hurts"
you pushed me up against my wall
threw my clothes down on the floor
"darling are you ready for more"
it was a bad idea calling you up
was such a bad idea i'm totally fucked
it was a bad idea to think i could stop
was such a bad idea i can't get enough
bad idea bad idea
bad idea bad idea
you put your hands under my shirt
undid my bra and said these words
"darling you're so pretty it hurts"
you pushed me up against my wall
threw my clothes down on the floor
"darling are you ready for more"
it was a bad idea calling you up
was such a bad idea i'm totally fucked
it was a bad idea to think i could stop
was such a bad idea i can't get enough
i've been hiding for so long
these feelings they're not gone
can i tell anyone
afraid of what they'll say
so i push them away
i'm acting so strange
they're so pretty it hurts
i'm not talking about boys i'm talking about girls
they're so pretty with their buttonup shirts
i shouldn't be feeling this
but it's too hard to resist
soft skin and soft lips
i should be into this guy
but it's just a waste of time
he's really not my type
i know what i like
no this is not a phase
or a coming of age
this will never change
they're so pretty it hurts
i'm not talking about boys i'm talking about girls
they're so pretty with their buttonup shirts
they're so pretty it hurts
i'm not talking about boys i'm talking about girls
they're so pretty with their buttonup shirts
'cause i don't know what to do
it's not like i get to choose who i love
who i love who i love who i love
they're so pretty it hurts
i'm not talking about boys i'm talking about girls
they're so pretty with their buttonup shirts
and they're so pretty it hurts
not talking about boys i'm talking about girls
they're so pretty it hurts

we fell in love in october
that's why i love fall
admiring from afar

feeling used but i'm
still missing you and i can't
see the end of this
just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
and now all this time is passing by
but i still can't seem to tell you why
it hurts me every time i see you
realize how much i need you
i hate you i love you
i hate that i love you
don't want to but i can't put
nobody else above you
i hate you i love you
i hate that i want you
you want her you need her
and i'll never be her
i miss you when i can't sleep
or right after coffee or right when i can't eat
i miss you in my front seat
still got sand in my sweaters from nights we don't remember
do you miss me like i miss you
fucked around and got attached to you
friends can break your heart too and
i'm always tired but never of you
if i pulled a you on you you wouldn't like that shit
i put this real out but you wouldn't bite that shit
i type a text but then i never mind that shit
i got these feelings but you never mind that shit
oh oh keep it on the low
you're still in love with me but your friends don't know
if you wanted me you would just say so
and if i were you i would never let me go
i don't mean no harm
i just miss you on my arm
wedding bells were just alarms
caution tape around my heart
you ever wonder what we coulda been
you said you wouldn't and you fucking did
lie to me lie with me get your fucking fix
now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
always missing people that i shouldn't be missing
sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
i know that i control my thoughts and i should stop reminiscing
but i learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
when love and trust are gone
everyone i do right does me wrong
so every lonely night i sing this song
i hate you i love you
i hate that i love you
don't want to but i can't put
nobody else above you
i hate you i love you
i hate that i want you
you want her you need her
and i'll never be her
all alone i watch you watch her
like she's the only girl you've ever seen
you don't care you never did
you don't give a damn about me
yeah all alone i watch you watch her
she's the only thing you've ever seen
how is it you never notice
that you are slowly killing me
i hate you i love you
i hate that i love you
don't want to but i can't put
nobody else above you
i hate you i love you
i hate that i want you
you want her you need her
and i'll never be her
now and then i think of when we were together
like when you said you felt so happy you could die
told myself that you were right for me
but felt so lonely in your company
but that was love and it's an ache i still remember
e|||||
e|||||
you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end
always the end
so when we found that we could not make sense
well you said that we would still be friends
but i'll admit that i was glad that it was over
but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened
and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so rough
you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records
and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that though
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over
but had me believing it was always something that i'd done
and i don't wanna live that way
reading into every word you say
you said that you could let it go
and i wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened
and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so rough
you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records
and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that though
now you're just somebody that i used to know
somebody i used to know
somebody now you're just somebody that i used to know
somebody i used to know
somebody now you're just somebody that i used to know
i used to know
that i used to know
i used to know
somebody
i don’t know my name
i don’t play by the rules of the game
so you say i’m just trying
just try ing
so i heard you are my sister’s friend
you get along quite nicely
you ask me why i cut my hair
and changed myself completely slower
i don’t know my name
i don’t play by the rules of the game
so you say i’m just trying
just try ing
i went from bland and popular to
joining the marching band
i made the closest friends i'll ever
have in my lifetime
i am lost
trying to get found
in an ocean of
people
please don't ask me anyquestions
there won't be a valid answer
i'll just say
i don’t know my name
i don’t play by the rules of the game
so you say i’m just trying a little faster
just try ing faster and louder
i now know my name
i don’t play by the rules of the game
so you say i’m not trying
but i’m try ing
to find my way
where can i find the city of shining light
in an ordinary world
how can i leave a buried treasure behind
in an ordinary world
the days into years roll by
it's where that i live until i die
ordinary world
mmmmmmmm
what would you wish if you saw a shooting star
in an ordinary world
i've walked to the end of the earth and afar
in an ordinary world
baby i don't have much
but what we have is more than enough
ordinary world
mmmmmmmm
where can i find the city of shining light
in an ordinary world
how can i leave a buried treasure behind
in an ordinary world
baby i don't have much
but what we have is more than enough
ordinary world
mmmmmmmm
weightlessness no gravity
were we somewhere inbetween
i'm a ghost of you you're a ghost of me
a bird'seye view of san luis
oh highway boys all sleeping in
with their dirty mouths and broken strings
oh their eyes are shining like the sea
for you the queen of san luis
i'm a ghost of you you're a ghost of me
a bird'seye view of san luis
cutting through the avenues
i'd always find my way to you
beside the hook the hammer lies
fumbling round in the smoke
spending time chasing ghosts
hold me down hold me down child
hold me down hold me down child
california called you queen
with your golden hair and magazine
were you somewhere inbetween
fast asleep a flying dream
i'm a ghost of you you're a ghost of me
a bird'seye view of san luis repeat chorus times to end

kuinka tää kaikki joskus häviää
ja se rikkaus joka kuuluu elämään
sitä silmillä pysty mä en näkemään
särkyköön suruni hetkeksi pois
eikä viha mun sisällä vaikeroi
tahdon vain hetkisen hengähtää
aion sulle kynttilän nyt sytyttää
valkoinen maa lunta sataa
tässä mä seison takki auki taas
tämä vuosi joitain suosi enemmän
valkoinen maa antaa sataa

woke up alone in this hotel room
played with myself where were you
fell back to sleep i got drunk by noon
i've never felt less cool


we haven't spoke since you went away
comfortable silence is so overrated
why won't you ever be the first one to break
even my phone misses your call by the way
i saw your friend that you know from work
he said you feel just fine
i see you gave him my old tshirt
more of what was once mine
i see it's written it's all over his face
comfortable silence is so overrated
why won't you ever say what you want to say
even my phone misses your call by the way
maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
but you you never do
woke up the girl who looked just like you
i almost said your name
we haven't spoke since you went away
comfortable silence is so overrated
why won't you ever say what you want to say
even my phone misses your call
we haven't spoke since you went away
comfortable silence is so overrated
why won't you ever say what you want to say
even my phone misses your call by the way

she worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
and all the boys they were saying they were into it
such a pretty face on a pretty neck
she's driving me crazy but i'm into it but i'm into it
it's getting crazy i think i'm losing it i think i'm losing it
i think she said "i'm having your baby it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby it's none of your business" it's none of your none of your
"i'm having your baby it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby it's none of your it's none of your"
it's new york baby always jacked up
holland tunnel for a nose it's always backed up
when she's alone she goes home to a cactus
in a black dress she's such an actress
she's driving me crazy but i'm into it but i'm into it
it's getting crazy i think i'm losing it i think i'm losing it
i think she said "i'm having your baby it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby it's none of your business" it's none of your none of your
"i'm having your baby it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby it's none of your it's none of your"
she sits beside me like a silhouette
hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
and now she's all over me it's like i paid for it
it's like i paid for it i'm gonna pay for this
it's none of your it's none of your
"i'm having your baby it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby it's none of your business" it's none of your it's none of your
"i'm having your baby it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby it's none of your business" it's none of your it's none of your

nine in the morning a man drops his kids off at school
and he's thinking of you like all of us do
sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
around like he knows what to do
she she she lives in daydreams with me she
she's the first one that i see and i don't know why
he takes a boat out imagines just sailing away away away
and not telling his mates not telling his mates
wouldn't know what to say wouldn't know what to say to say
she she she lives in daydreams with me she
she's the first one that i see and i don't know why
she she she's the first one that i see she
she lives in daydreams with me and i don't know why
lives for the memory
a woman who's just in his head just in his head
and she sleeps in his bed his bed
while he plays pretend pretend
so pretend pretend
she she she lives in daydreams with me she
she's the first one that i see and i don't know why
she she she's the first one that i see she
she lives in daydreams with me and i don't know why

just stop your crying
it’s a sign of the times
welcome to the final show
you can't bribe the door
on your way to the sky
you look pretty good down here
if we never learn we've been here before
why are we always stuck and
running from the bullets
the bullets
we never learn we've been here before
why are we always stuck and
running from the bullets
the bullets
just stop your crying
it’s a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your crying
it’ll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here
just stop your crying
have the time of your life
breakin' through the atmosphere
remember everything will be alright
we could meet again somewhere
we never learn we've been here before
why are we always stuck and
running from the bullets
the bullets
we never learn we've been here before
why are we always stuck and
running from the bullets
the bullets
just stop your crying
it’s a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
stop your crying baby
it’ll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here
if we never learn we've been here before
why are we always stuck and
running from the bullets
the bullets
we never learn we've been here before
why are we always stuck and
running from the bullets
the bullets
we don't talk enough
we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know
stop your crying baby

i know that you're trying to be friends i know you mean it
don't call me "baby" again it's hard for me to go home
be so lonely
i just hope you see me in a little better light

sounds like something that i used to feel
but i can't touch what i see
we're not who we used to be
we're not who we used to be
we're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
the fridge light washes this room white
moon dances over your good side
this was all we used to need
tonguetied like we've never known
telling those stories we already told
'cause we don't say what we really mean
we're not who we used to be
we're not who we used to be
we're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
we're not who we used to be
we're not who we used to be
we're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
we're not who we used to be
we're not who we used to be
we're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
we're not who we used to be
we don't see what we used to see
we're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
i'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

here i am
down on my knees again
surrendering all
surrendering all
find me here
lord as you draw me near
desperate for you
desperate for you
i surrender
drench my soul
as mercy and grace unfold
i hunger and thirst
i hunger and thirst
with arms stretched wide
i know you hear my cry
speak to me now
speak to me now
i surrender
i surrender
i want to know you more
i want to know you more
like a rushing wind
jesus breathe within
lord have your way
lord have your way in me
like a mighty storm
stir within my soul
lord have your way
lord have your way in me
you call me out upon the waters
the great unknown where feet may fail
and there i find you in the mystery
in oceans deep my faith will stand
and i will call upon your name
and keep my eyes above the waves
when oceans rise my soul will rest in your embrace
for i am yours and you are mine
your grace abounds in deepest waters
your sovereign hand will be my guide
where feet may fail and fear surrounds me

god of creation
there at the start before the beginning of time
with no point of reference
you spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light
and as you speak
a hundred billion galaxies are born
in the vapour of your breath the planets form
if the stars were made to worship so will i
i can see your heart in everything you've made
every burning star a signal fire of grace
if creation sings your praises so will i
god of your promise
you don't speak in vain no syllable empty or void
for once you have spoken
all nature and science follow the sound of your voice
and as you speak
a hundred billion creatures catch your breath
evolving in pursuit of what you said
if it all reveals your nature so will i
i can see your heart in everything you say
every painted sky a canvas of your grace
if creation still obeys you so will i
so will i so will i
if the stars were made to worship so will i
if the mountains bow in reverence so will i
if the oceans roar your greatness so will i
for if everything exists to lift you high so will i
and if the wind goes where you send it so will i
if the rocks cry out in silence so will i
if the sum of all our praises still falls shy
then we'll sing again a hundred billion times
whoa
god of salvation
you chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
on a hill you created
the light of the world abandoned in darkness to die
and as you speak
a hundred billion failures disappear
where you lost your life so i could find it here
if you left the grave behind you so will i
i can see your heart in everything you've done
every part designed in a work of art called love
if you gladly chose surrender so will i
i can see in your heart eight billion different ways
every precious one a child you died to save
if you gave your life to love them so will i
like you would again a hundred billion times
but what measure could amount to your de sire
you're the one who never leaves the one behind
you were the word at the beginning
one with god the lord most high
your hidden glory in creation
now revealed in you our christ

i will build my life upon your love
it is a firm foundation
and i will put my trust in you alone
and i will not be shaken
i watch the work of my kin bold and boyful
toying somewhere between love and abuse
calling to join them the wretched and joyful
shaking the wings of their terrible youths
freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
no more alone or myself could i be
lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
no shortage of sordid no protest from me
with her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
she's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
with her strawblonde hair her arms hard and lean
she's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
feeling more human and hooked on her flesh i
lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
fresh from the fields all fetor and fertile
it's bloody and raw but i swear it is sweet
with her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
she's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
with her strawblonde hair her arms hard and lean
she's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
instrumental of "verse"
leashless confusion i'll wander the concrete
wonder if better now having survived
jarring of judgement and reasons defeat
the sweet heat of her breath in my mouth i'm alive
with her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
she's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
with her strawblonde hair her arms hard and lean
she's the angel of small death and the codeine scene


babe
there's something tragic about you
something so magic about you
don't you agree
babe
there's something lonesome about you
something so wholesome about you
get closer to me
no tired sigh no rolling eyes no irony
no 'who cares' no vacant stares no time for me
honey you're familiar like my mirror years ago
idealism sits in prison chivalry fell on it's sword
innocence died screaming honey ask me i should know
i slithered here from eden just to sit outside your door
intro riff
babe
there's something wretched about this
something so precious about this
where to begin
babe
there's something broken about this
but i might be open about this
oh what a sin
to the strand a picnic plan for you and me
a rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree
honey you're familiar like my mirror years ago
idealism sits in prison chivalry fell on it's sword
innocence died screaming honey ask me i should know
i slithered here from eden just to sit outside your door
honey you're familiar like my mirror years ago
idealism sits in prison chivalry fell on it's sword
innocence died screaming honey ask me i should know
i slithered here from eden just to hide outside your door
i had a thought dear
however scary
about that night
the bugs and the dirt
why were you digging
what did you bury
before those hands pulled me
from the earth
i will not ask you where you came from
i will not ask and neither should you
honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
we should just kiss like real people do
i knew that look dear
eyes always seeking
was there in someone
that dug long ago
so i will not ask you
why you were creeping
in some sad way i already know
so i will not ask you where you came from
i would not ask and neither would you
honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
we should just kiss like real people do
i could not ask you where you came from
honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
we could just kiss like real people do
my lover's got humour
she's the giggle at a funeral
knows everybody's disapproval
i should've worshipped her sooner
if the heavens ever did speak
she is the last true mouthpiece
every sunday's getting more bleak
a fresh poison each week
'we were born sick' you heard them say it
my church offers no absolutes
she tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
the only heaven i'll be sent to
is when i'm alone with you
i was born sick but i love it
command me to be well
aaaaaaaaaaamen amen amen
take me to church i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
good god let me give you my life
if i'm a pagan of the good times
my lover's the sunlight
to keep the goddess on my side
she demands a sacrifice
to drain the whole sea
get something shiny
something meaty for the main course
that's a fine looking high horse
what you got in the stable
we've a lot of starving faithful
that looks tasty
that looks plenty
this is hungry work
take me to church i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
good god let me give you my life
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then i am human only then i am clean
aaaaaaaaaaamen amen amen
take me to church i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
good god let me give you my life
take me to church i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
good god let me give you my life
oh hush my dear it's been a difficult year
and terrors don't prey on innocent victims
trust me darlin' trust me darlin'
it's been a loveless year
i'm a man of three fears
integrity faith and crocodile tears
trust me darlin' trust me darlin'
so look me in the eyes
tell me what you see
perfect paradise
tearing at the seams
i wish i could escape it
i don't want to fake it
i wish i could erase it
but i'm a bad liar
bad liar
now you know
now you know
i'm a bad liar
bad liar
now you know
did all my dreams never mean one thing
does happiness lie in a diamond ring

i wage my war on the world inside
i take my gun to the enemy's side
oh i've been asking for trust me darlin'
oh i've been asking trust me darlin' for problems problems problems
so look me in the eyes

all the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove ohooh

falling like ashes to the ground
hoping my feelings they would drown
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
till it broke up and it rained down

my life my love my god they came from
pain
you made me a you made me a believer believer
when the days are cold
and the cards all fold
and the saints we see
are all made of gold
when your dreams all fail
and the ones we hail
are the worst of all
and the blood’s run stale
i want to hide the truth
i want to shelter you
but with the beast inside
there’s nowhere we can hide
no matter what we breed
we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come
this is my kingdom come
when you feel my heat
look into my eyes
it’s where my demons hide
it’s where my demons hide
don’t get too close
it’s dark inside
it’s where my demons hide
it’s where my demons hide
when the curtain’s call
is the last of all
when the lights fade out
all the sinners crawl
so they dug your grave
and the masquerade
will come calling out
at the mess you made
don’t wanna let you down
but i am hellbound
though this is all for you
don’t wanna hide the truth
no matter what we breed
we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come
this is my kingdom come
when you feel my heat
look into my eyes
it’s where my demons hide
it’s where my demons hide
don’t get too close
it’s dark inside
it’s where my demons hide
it’s where my demons hide
they say it's what you make
i say it's up to fate
it's woven in my soul
i need to let you go
your eyes they shine so bright
i want to save that light
i can't escape this now
when you feel my heat
look into my eyes
it’s where my demons hide
it’s where my demons hide
don’t get too close
it’s dark inside
it’s where my demons hide
it’s where my demons hide
so this is what you meant when you said that you were spent
and now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit right to the top
packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
i don't ever want to let you down
i don't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all
it's time to begin isn't it
i get a little bit bigger but then
i'll admit i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
so this is where you fell and i am left to sell
the path that heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
right to the top
turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check
i don't ever want to let you down
i don't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all
it's time to begin isn't it
i get a little bit bigger but then
i'll admit i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
it's time to begin isn't it
i get a little bit bigger but then
i'll admit i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
this road never looked so lonely
this house doesn't burn down slowly
to ashes to ashes
it's time to begin isn't it
i get a little bit bigger but then
i'll admit i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
it's time to begin isn't it
i get a little bit bigger but then
i'll admit i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
i'm waking up to ash and dust
i wipe my brow and i sweat my rust
i'm breathing in the chemicals gasp
i'm breaking in shaping up then checking out on the prison bus
this is it the apocalypse
whoa
i'm waking up i feel it in my bones
enough to make my systems blow

as a child you would wait
and watch from far away
but you always knew that you'd be the one
to work while they all play
in youth you'd lay
awake at night and scheme
of all the things that you would change
but it was just a dream
here we are don't turn away now
we are the warriors that built this town
here we are don't turn away now
we are the warriors that built this town
from dust
the time will come
when you'll have to rise
above the best and prove yourself
your spirit never dies
farewell i've gone
to take my throne above
but don't weep for me 'cuz this will be
the labor of my love
here we are don't turn away now
we are the warriors that built this town
here we are don't turn away now
we are the warriors that built this town
from dust

cause a light came on when i heard that song
and i want you to sing it again

but i know you never saw me
when the lights come on and i'm on my own
will you be there to sing it again

can i be him
i heard there was someone but i know he don't deserve you
if you were mine i'd never let anyone hurt you
i wanna dry those tears kiss those lips
it's all that i've been thinking about
cause a light came on when i heard that song
and i want you to sing it again
i swear that every word you sing

i remember years ago
someone told me i should take
caution when it comes to love
i did i did
and you were strong and i was not
my illusion my mistake
i was careless i forgot
i did
and now when all is done
there is nothing to say
you have gone and so effortlessly
you can go ahead tell them
tell them all i know now
shout it from the rooftops
write it on the skyline
all we had is gone now
tell them i was happy
and my heart is broken
all my scars are open
tell them what i hoped would be
impossible impossible
impossible impossible
falling out of love is hard
falling for betrayal is worse
broken trust and broken hearts
i know i know
thinking all you need is there
building faith on love and words
empty promises will wear
i know i know
and now when all is done
there is nothing to say
and if you're done with embarrassing me

impossible impossible
impossible impossible
i remember years ago
someone told me i should take
caution when it comes to love

write it on the skyline
all we had is gone now
tell them i was happy
and my heart is broken
all my scars are open
tell them what i hoped would be
impossible impossible
impossible impossible
impossible impossible
impossible impossible
i met you in the dark
you lit me up
you made me feel as though
i was enough
we danced the night away
we drank too much
i held your hair back when
you were throwing up
then you smiled over your shoulder
for a minute i was stone cold sober
i pulled you closer to my chest
and you asked me to stay over
i said i already told ya
i think that you should get some rest
i knew i loved you then
but you'd never know
cause i played it cool when i was
scared of letting go
i know i needed you
but i never showed
but i wanna stay with you
until we're grey and old
just say you won't let go
just say you won't let go
i wake you up with some
breakfast in bed
i'll bring you coffee with
a kiss on your head
and i'll take the kids to school
wave them goodbye
and i'll thank my lucky stars
for that night
when you looked over your shoulder
for a minute i forget that i'm older
i wanna dance with you right now oh
and you look as beautiful as ever
and i swear that everyday you'll get better
you make me feel this way somehow
i'm so in love with you
and i hope you know
darling your love is more than
worth its weight in gold
we've come so far my dear
look how we've grown
and i wanna stay with you
until we're grey and old
just say you won't let go
just say you won't let go
i wanna live with you
even when we're ghosts
cause you were always there for me
when i needed you most
i'm gonna love you till
my lungs give out
i promise till death we part
like in our vows
so i wrote this song for you
now everybody knows
that it's just you and me
until we're grey and old
just say you won't let go
just say you won't let go
just say you won't let go
oh just say you won't let go

laying in the silence
waiting for the sirens

unsay these spoken words

from throwin' clothes across the floor
to teeth and claws and slammin' doors at you
if this is all we're livin' for
why are we doin' it doin' it doin' it anymore

and we're becomin' somethin' else

sometimes i'm beaten
sometimes i'm broke
'cause sometimes this city is nothing but smoke
is there a secret
is there a code
can we make it better
'cause i'm losing hope
tell me how to be in this world
tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
tell me how 'cause i believe in something
i believe in us
after the wreckage
after the dust
i still hear the howling i still feel the rush
over the riots above all the noise
through all the worry i still hear your voice
tell me how to be in this world
tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
tell me now 'cause i believe in something
i believe in us
tell me where the light goes down
so even in the dark we can find our way out
tell me now 'cause i believe in something
i believe in us
we used to be kids living just for kicks
in cinema seats learning how to kiss
running through streets that were painted gold
we never believed we'd grow up like this
tell me how to be in this world
tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
tell me now 'cause i believe in something
i believe in us
tell me where the light goes down
so even in the dark we can find our way out
tell me now 'cause i believe in something
i believe in us
tell me now 'cause i believe in something
and i believe in us
your mouth is a revolver firing bullets in the sky
your love is like a soldier loyal till you die
and i've been looking at the stars for a long long time
i've been putting out fires all my life
everybody wants a flame but they don't want to get burnt
and today is our turn
days like these lead to nights like this lead to love like ours

people like us we don't need that much
just someone that starts starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
this world is getting colder strangers passing by
no one offers you a shoulder no one looks you in the eye
but i've been looking at you for a long long time
just trying to break through trying to make you mine

a heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun it can’t trust anyone
i was so sure what i needed was more tried to shoot out the sun
in days when we raged we flew off the page such damage was done
but i made it through ‘cause somebody knew i was meant for someone
so girl leave your boots by the bed we ain’t leavin’ this room
'til someone needs medical help or the magnolia’s bloom
it’s cold in this house and i ain’t goin’ out to chop wood
so cover me up and know you’re enough to use me for good
put your faith to the test when i tore off your dress in richmond on high
i sobered up and i swore off that stuff forever this time
and the old lovers sing "i thought it’d be me who helped him get home"
but home was a dream one i’d never seen ‘til you came along
so girl hang your dress up to dry we ain’t leavin’ this room
'til the percy priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
carries this house on the stones like a piece of driftwood
cover me up and know you’re enough to use me for good
so girl leave your boots by the bed we ain’t leavin’ this room
'til someone needs medical help or the magnolia’s bloom
it’s cold in this house and i ain’t goin’ out to chop wood
so cover me up and know you’re enough to use me for good
cover me up and know you’re enough to use me for good
when i look into your eyes
it's like watching the night sky
or a beautiful sunrise
well there's so much they hold
and just like them old stars
i see that you've come so far
to be right where you are
how old is your soul
i won't give up on us
even if the skies get rough
i'm giving you all my love
i'm still looking up
and when you're needing your space
to do some navigaaaating
i'll be here patiently waiting
to see what you find
'cause even the stars they burn
some even fall to the earth
we got a lot to learn
god knows we're worth it
no i won't give up
i don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
i'm here to stay and make the difference that i can make
our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
the tools the skills we've got yeah we got a lot at stake
and in the end you're still my friend at least we didn't tend
for us to work we didn't break we didn't burn
i had to learn what i got and what i'm not
and who i am
i won't give up on us
even if the skies get rough
i'm giving you all my love
i'm still looking up still looking up
i won't give up on us
god knows i'm tough enough
we got a lot to learn

all that i have is a river
the river is always my home
lord take me away for i just cannot stay
or i'll sink in my skin and my bones
the water sustains me without even trying
the water can't drown me i'm done
with my dyying
please help me build a small boat
one that'll ride on the flow
where the river runs deep and the larger fish creep
i'm glad of what keeps me afloat
the water sustains me without even trying
the water can't drown me i'm done
with my dyying
now deeper the water i sail
and faster the current i'm in
but each night brings the stars
and the song in my heart
is a tune for the journeyman's tale
the water sustains me without even trying
the water can't drown me i'm done
with my dyying
now the land that i knew is a dream
and the line on the distance grows faint
so wide is my river the horizon a sliver
the artist has run out of paint
where the blue of the sea meets the sky
and the big yellow sun leads me home
i'm everywhere now the way is a vow
to the wind of each breath by and by
the water sustains me without even trying
the water can't drown me i'm done
with my dyying
i don't want a friend just me
i want my life in two my life in two
waiting to get there
waiting for you all night
i'm done fighting all night
when i'm around slow dancing in the dark
don't follow me you'll end up in my arms
i don't need no more signs
can you
give me reasons we should be complete
you should be with him i can't compete
you looked at me like i was someone else oh well
can't you see can't you see
i don't wanna slow dance i don't want to slow dance
in the dark
dark
when you gotta run
just hear my voice in you my voice in you
shutting me out of you shutting me out of you
doing so great so great so great
you
used to be the one to hold you when you fall
i don't fuck with your tone i don't fuck with your tone
can it be one night
can you
give me reasons we should be complete
you should be with him i can't compete
you looked at me like i was someone else oh well
can't you see can't you see
i don't wanna slow dance i don't want to slow dance
in the dark
dark
in the dark
dark
i guess i should stop
looking out for you
like i always do
when will you
start looking out for me too
instead of leaving me staring at my shoes
just the way you're glancing at me
something about you
just makes me feel guilty for
liking you
when you're with him
when you're with him
this is a love song for a girl
who will never know it's about her
know it's pretty stupid
but i'm much too shy to tell her
she's beaming that smile all the while
i'm all tripped up on my own throat
i guess there is no hope
when you're walking out in the snow
i say i guess i should go
and we're talking about someone else
when we should be talking about ourselves
it's the same old situation you've always got me waiting
come on dear i think times a wastin'
before we have to go back inside
and return to our normal lives
this is a love song for a girl
who will never know it's about her
know it's pretty stupid
but i'm much too shy to tell her
she's beaming that smile all the while
i'm all tripped up on my own throat
i guess there is no hope
ooooooooooooooooo
i was distracted and in traffic
i didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
but it really got me thinkin' were you out drinkin'
were you in the livin' room chillin' watchin' television
it's been a year now think i've figured out how
how to let you go and let communication die out
i know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
i know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
but if the world was ending you'd come over right
you'd come over and you'd stay the night
would you love me for the hell of it
all our fears would be irrelevant
if the world was ending you'd come over right
the sky'd be falling and i'd hold you tight
and there wouldn't be a reason why
we would even have to say goodbye
if the world was ending you'd come over right
right
if the world was ending you'd come over right
right
i tried to imagine your reaction
it didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
but it really got me thinkin' that night we went drinkin'
stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
ah it's been a year now think i've figured out how
how to think about you without it rippin' my heart out
and i know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
i know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
but if the world was ending you'd come over right
you'd come over and you'd stay the night
would you love me for the hell of it
all our fears would be irrelevant
if the world was ending you'd come over right
the sky'd be falling while i'd hold you tight
no there wouldn't be a reason why
we would even have to say goodbye
if the world was ending you'd come over right
you'd come over right you'd come over you'd come over you'd come over right
i know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
i know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
but if the world was ending you'd come over right
you'd come over and you'd stay the night
would you love me for the hell of it
all our fears would be irrelevant
if the world was ending you'd come over right
the sky'd be falling while i'd hold you tight
no there wouldn't be a reason why
we would even have to say goodbye
if the world was ending you'd come over right
you'd come over you'd come over you'd come over right hmm
if the world was ending you'd come over right

sa dilaw na buwan
at iyong ganda'y umaabot sa buwan
ang tibok ng puso'y tinig sa kalawakan
at kung mabalik dito sa akin ikaw ang mahal ikaw lang ang mamahalin
pakinggan ang puso't damdamin
damdamin aking damdamin
sa ilalim ng puting ilaw
sa dilaw na buwan
pakinggan mo ang aking sigaw
sa dilaw na buwan

my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on
and now i know i'm better sleeping on my own
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'

cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself
for all the times that you made me feel small
i fell in love now i feel nothin' at all

was i a fool to let you break down my walls
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

do you ever feel like a plastic bag
drifting through the wind
wanting to start again
do you ever feel feel so paper thin
like a house of cards
one blow from caving in
do you ever feel already buried deep
feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that there's still a chance for you
'cause there's a spark in you
you just gotta
ignite the light and let it shine
just own the night like the of july
'cause baby you're a firework
come on show 'em what you're worth
make 'em go "oh oh oh"
as you shoot across the skyyy
baby you're a firework
come on let your colors burst
make 'em go "oh oh oh"
you're gonna leave 'em all in awe awe awe
you don't have to feel like a waste of space
you're original cannot be replaced
if you only knew what the future holds
after a hurricane comes a rainbow
maybe your reason why all the doors are closed
so you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
like a lightning bolt your heart will blow
and when it's time you'll know
you just gotta
ignite the light and let it shine
just own the night like the of july
'cause baby you're a firework
come on show 'em what you're worth

we've taken different paths and traveled different roads
i know we'll always end up on the same one when we're old
and when you're in the trenches and you're under fire i will cover you
if i was dying on my knees
you would be the one to rescue me
and if you were drowned at sea
i'd give you my lungs so you could breathe

beneath the skin of our tattoos
though we don't share the same blood
you're my brother and i love you that's the truth

if we'll make it back with all our fingers and our toes
years years come back we'll always be the same

and if you were drowned at sea
i'd give you my lungs so you could breathe

broken bottles in the hotel lobby
seems to me like i'm just scared of never feeling it again
i know it's crazy to believe in silly things
it's not that easy
i remember it now it takes me back to when it all first started
but i only got myself to blame for it and i accept that now
it's time to let it go go out and start again
but it's not that easy
high hopes it takes me back to when we started
high hopes when you let it go go out and start again
high hopes when it all comes to an end
but the world keeps spinning around
and in my dreams i meet the ghosts of all the people who've come and gone
memories they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
naive i was just staring at the barrel of the gun
and i do believe that
high hopes it takes me back to when we started
high hopes when you let it go go out and start again
high hopes oh when it all comes to an end
and the world keeps spinning
yeah the world keeps spinning around
high hopes it takes me back to when we started
high hopes when you let it go go out and start again
high hopes ooohhh
and the world keeps spinning
yeah this world keeps spinning
how this world keeps spinning around


i had a dream
we were sipping whisky neat
highest floor the bowery
nowhere's high enough
somewhere along the lines
we stopped seeing eye to eye
you were staying out all night
and i had enough
no i don't wanna know where you been or where you're going
but i know i won't be home
and you'll be on your own
who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep
who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone
who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
i had a dream
we were back to seventeen
summer nights and the libertines
never growing up
i'll take with me
the polaroids and the memories
but you know i'm gonna leave
behind the worst of us
who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep
who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone
who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
it ain't me no no
it ain't me no no
it ain't me no no
who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning it ain't me

i'm jealous of the rain
that falls upon your skin
it's closer than my hands have been
i'm jealous of the rain
i'm jealous of the wind
that ripples through your clothes
it's closer than your shadow
oh i'm jealous of the wind cause
i wished you the best of
all this world could give
and i told you when you left me
there's nothing to forgive
but i always thought you'd come back tell me all you found was
heartbreak and misery
it's hard for me to say i'm jealous of the way
you're happy without me
i'm jealous of the nights
that i don't spend with you
i'm wondering who you lay next to
oh i'm jealous of the nights
i'm jealous of the love
love that was in here
gone for someone else to share
oh i'm jealous of the love cause
i wished you the best of
all this world could give
and i told you when you left me
there's nothing to forgive
but i always thought you'd come back tell me all you found was
heartbreak and misery
it's hard for me to say i'm jealous of the way
you're happy without me
as i sink in the sand
watch you slip through my hands
oh as i die here another day
cause all i do is cry behind this smile
i wished you the best of
all this world could give
and i told you when you left me
there's nothing to forgive
but i always thought you'd come back tell me all you found was
heartbreak and misery
it's hard for me to say i'm jealous of the way
you're happy without me eeee
it's hard for me to say i'm jealous of the way
you're happy without me
picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
reaching for the phone 'cause i can't fight it anymore
and i wonder if i ever cross your mind
for me it happens all the time
it's a quarter after one i'm all alone and i need you now
said i wouldn't come but i lost all control and i need you now
and i don't know how i can do without i just need you now
another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door
wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
and i wonder if i ever cross your mind
for me it happens all the time
it's a quarter after one i'm a little drunk and i need you now
said i wouldn't come but i lost all control and i need you now
and i don't know how i can do without i just need you now

i was like "no please" "stay here"
"we don't need no money we can make it all work"

chasing paper

i would wait a milion years
promise you'll remember that you're mine
baby can you see through the tears
love you more than those bitches before

he went out every night and baby that's alright
i told you that no matter what you did i'd be by your side
cause i'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
well shit at least you tried
but when you walked out that door a piece of me died
i told you i wanted more but that not what i had in mind

two lines here can play just the higher note at fret g string or combine the two parts
feet don't fail me now
take me to the finish line
all my heart it breaks every step that i take
but i'm hoping that the gates
walking through the city streets
is it by mistake or design'
i feel so alone on a friday night
can you make it feel like home if i tell you you're mine
don't make me sad don't make me cry
sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
i don't know why
keep making me laugh
let's go get high
road's long we carry on
try to have fun in the meantime
come and take a walk on the wild side
let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
you like your girls insane
choose your last words
this is the last time
cause you and i we were born to die
lost but now i am found
i can see but once i was blind
i was so confused as a little child
tried to take what i could get
scared that i couldn't find
don't make me sad don't make me cry
sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
i don't know why
keep making me laugh
let's go get high
road's long we carry on

playing pool and wild darts
video games

when i'm no longer young and beautiful
will you still love me
when i got nothing but my aching soul
i know you will i know you will

g or
do you remember me
i sat upon your knee
i wrote to you
with childhood fantasies
well i'm all grown up now
and still need help somehow
i'm not a child
but my heart still can dream
so here's my lifelong wish
my grown up christmas list
not for myself
but for a world in need
no more lives torn apart
that wars would never start
and time would heal all hearts
and everyone would have a friend
and right would always win
and love would never end
this is my grown up christmas list
as children we believed
the grandest sight to see
was something lovely
wrapped beneath our tree
but heaven only knows
that packages and bows
can never heal
a hurting human soul
no more lives torn apart
that wars would never start
and time would heal all hearts
and everyone would have a friend
and right would always win
and love would never end
this is my grown up christmas list
what is this illusion called
the innocence of youth
maybe only in our blind belief
can we ever find the truth
no more lives torn apart
that wars would never start
and time would heal all hearts
and everyone would have a friend
and right would always win
and love would never end
this is my grown up christmas list
this is my grown up christmas list
my grown up christmas list
the world waits for a miracle
the heart longs for a little bit of hope
o come o come emmanuel
a child prays for peace on earth
and she's calling out from a sea of hurt
o come o come emmanuel
and can you hear
the angels singing
glory to the light of the world
glory the light of the world is here
the drought breaks with the tears of a mother
a babies cry is the sound of love come down
come down come down emmanuel
he is the song for the suffering
he has come emmanuel
glory to the light of the world
glory to the light of the world
glory to the light of the world
glory to the light of the world
for all who wait
for all who hunger
for all who've pained
for all who wonder
behold your king
behold messiah
emmanuel emmanuel
glory to the light of the world
glory to the light of the world
glory to the light of the world
behold your king
behold messiah
emmanuel emmanuel
glory to the light of the world
glory to the light of the world
glory to the light of the world
the world waits for a miracle
the heart longs for a little bit of hope
o come o come emmanuel

counting days counting days
since my love up and got lost on me
and every breath that i've been taken
since you left feels like a waste on me
i've been holding on to hope
that you'll come back when you can find some peace
'cause every word that i've heard spoken
since you left feels like a hollow street
i've been told i've been told to get you off my mind
but i hope i never lose the bruises that you left behind
oh my lord oh my lord i need you by my side
there must be something in the water
'cause every day it's getting colder
and if only i could hold you
you'd keep my head from going under
maybe i maybe i'm just being blinded
by the brighter side
of what we had because it's over
well there must be something in the tide
i've been told i've been told to get you off my mind
but i hope i never lose the bruises that you left behind
oh my lord oh my lord i need you by my side
there must be something in the water
'cause every day it's getting colder
and if only i could hold you
you'd keep my head from going under
oohoohoohoohooh

and i'm tired of being so exhausted
your love i'm lost in
your love i'm lost in
your love i'm lost in
even though i'm nothing to you now
even though i'm nothing to you now
there must be something in the water
'cause every day it's getting colder
and if only i could hold you
you'd keep my head from going under
there must be something in the water
'cause every day it's getting colder
and if only i could hold you
you'd keep my head from going under
caught me off guard i wish that i'd been sober
still here we are back in hanover
just like old times all over
under the exit lights as beautiful as ever
i really wish that i dressed up a little better
no regrets is what we said we can't go back again darling
nobody said that it would last forever
that doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
i never said that we would die together
that doesn't mean it was a lie remember
nobody said that it would last forever
head in my hands cold coffee on the table
wish you the best i would if i was able
morning light it stings a little
out of my mind i don't remember calling
had too much tonic wine sometimes it does the talking
hope you know i wish you all the love you're looking for darling
nobody said that it would last forever
that doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
i never said that we would die together
that doesn't mean it was a lie remember
nobody said that it would last forever
forever
forever
forever
nobody said that it would last forever
that doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
i never said that we would die together
that doesn't mean it was a lie they'll never
take those long summer days
when love was untamed
two burning hearts that dared to break remember
nobody said that it would last forever
i'm waitin' up savin' all my precious time
losin' light i'm missin' my same old us
before we learned our truth too late
resigned to fate fadin' away
so tell me can you turn around
i need someone to tear me down

but either way

i'm going under and this time i fear there's no one to save me
this all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
i need somebody to heal somebody to know somebody to have somebody to hold
it's easy to say but it's never the same
i guess i kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
now the day bleeds into nightfall
and you're not here to get me through it all
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
i'm going under and this time i fear there's no one to turn to
this all or nothing way of lovin' got me sleepin' without you
now i need somebody to know somebody to heal somebody to have just to know how it feels
it's easy to say but it's never the same
i guess i kinda liked the way you helped me escape
now the day bleeds into nightfall
and you're not here to get me through it all
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
and i tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
i fall into your arms
i'll be safe in your sound 'til i come back around
for now the day bleeds into nightfall
and you're not here to get me through it all
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
but now the day bleeds into nightfall
and you're not here to get me through it all
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

and our hair will be grey

and see the children are starving
and their houses were destroyed
don't think they could forgive youou
hey when seas will cover lands
and when men will be no more
don't think you can forgive you
yah when there'll just be silence
and when life will be over
don't think you will forgive youou
i walked across an empty land
i knew the pathway like the back of my hand
i felt the earth beneath my feet
sat by the river and it made me complete
oh simple thing where have you gone
i'm getting tired and i need someone to rely on
i came across a fallen tree
i felt the branches of it looking at me
is this the place we used to love
is this the place that i've been dreaming of
oh simple thing where have you gone
i'm getting old and i need something to rely on
and if you have a minute why don't we go
talk about it somewhere only we know
this could be the end of everything
so why don't we go somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know
oh simple thing where have you gone
i'm getting old and i need someone to rely on
so tell me when you're gonna let me in
i'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin
and if you have a minute why don't we go
talk about it somewhere only we know
'cos this could be the end of everything
so why don't we go somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know
take me down to the river bend
take me down to the fighting end
wash the poison from off my skin
show me how to be whole again
fly me up on a silver wing
past the black where the sirens sing
warm me up in a nova's glow
and drop me down to the dream below
cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see
bring me home in blinding dream
through the secrets that i have seen
wash the sorrow from off my skin
and show me how to be whole again
cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see
cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything else i need to be
cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see
for you to see
should've stayed were there signs i ignored
can i help you not to hurt anymore
we saw brilliance when the world was asleep
there are things that we can have but can't keep if they say
who cares if one more light goes out
in a sky of a million stars
who cares when someone's time runs out
if a moment is all we are
who cares if one more light goes out
well i do
the reminders pull the floor from your feet
in the kitchen one more chair than you need oh
and you're angry and you should be it's not fair
just 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there if they say
who cares if one more light goes out
in a sky of a million stars
who cares when someone's time runs out
if a moment is all we are
who cares if one more light goes out
well i do
who cares if one more light goes out
in a sky of a million stars
who cares when someone's time runs out
if a moment is all we are
who cares if one more light goes out
well i do

your instincts telling you to run

they'll sing to you they'll be your guide back home
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
it keeps us kind
when you suffered enough
and your spirit is breaking
you're growing desperate from the fights

when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind

take me back to the night we met
i don't know what i'm supposed to do haunted by the ghost of you
oh take me back to the night we met
when the night was full of terror
and your eyes were filled with tears
when you had not touched me yet
oh take me back to the night we met
i had all and then most of you some and now none of you
take me back to the night we met
i don't know what i'm supposed to do haunted by the ghost of you
take me back to the night we met
em ame note for ease of reading em shown for emb
baby really hurt me crying in the taxi he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i go home into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands play at romance we slow dance in the living room
but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone stroking her cheek
they say you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me
so they pull back make other plans i understand
i'm a liability
get you wild make you leave
i'm a little much for eh ananana everyone
the truth is i am toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting running through the night but
every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own
they say you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me
so they pull back make other plans i understand
i'm a liability
get you wild make you leave
i'm a little much for eh ananana everyone
they're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
you're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun


i've never seen a diamond in the flesh
i cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
and i'm not proud of my address in the torn up town
but every song's like gold teeth grey goose trippin' in the bathroom
we don't care we're driving cadillacs in our dreams
but everybody's like cristal mayback diamonds on your timepiece
we don't care we aren't caught up in your love affair
and we'll never be royals it don't run in our blood
that kind of lux just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz
let me be your ruler you can call me queen bee
and baby i'll rule i'll rule i'll rule i'll rule
let me live that fantasy
my friends and i we've cracked the code
we count our dollars on the train to the party
and everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
but every song's like gold teeth grey goose trippin' in the bathroom
we don't care we're driving cadillacs in our dreams
but everybody's like cristal mayback diamonds on your timepiece
we don't care we aren't caught up in your love affair
and we'll never be royals it don't run in our blood
that kind of lux just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz
let me be your ruler you can call me queen bee
and baby i'll rule i'll rule i'll rule i'll rule
let me live that fantasy
we're bigger than we ever dreamed
and i'm in love with being queen king
oh ooh oh ohh
life's a game without a care
we aren't caught up in your love affair
and we'll never be royals it don't run in our blood
that kind of lux just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz
let me be your ruler you can call me queen bee
and baby i'll rule i'll rule i'll rule i'll rule
let me live that fantasy
darling i'm with st bernard's
and we're scouring the alps and the andes
and if they die then it is on my head
they follow paw prints in the snow to my throne to my bed
you're pouting in your sleep i'm waking still yawning
we're proving to each other that romance is boring
sure there are things i could do if i was half prepared to
prove to each other that romance is boring
start as you mean to continue
complacent and selfinvolved
you're trying not to be nervous
if you were trying at all
i will wake i will bake phallic cake
take your diffidence make it my clubhouse
but my strength's within lies ventricle cauterized
it's the way of living that i espouse
you're pouting in your sleep i'm waking still yawning
we're proving to each other that romance is boring
sure there are things i could do if i was half prepared to
prove to each other that romance is boring
we are two ships that pass in the night
you and i we are nothing alike
i am a pleasure cruise you are gone out to trawl
return nets empty nothing at all
you're pouting in your sleep i'm waking still yawning
we're proving to each other that romance is boring
sure there are things i could do if i was half prepared to
prove to each other that romance is boring
it's been a minute since i called you
just to hear the answerphone
yeah i know that you won't get this
but i'll leave a message so i'm not alone
this morning i woke up still dreaming
with memories playing through my head
you'll never know how much i miss you
the day that they took you i wish it was me instead
but you once told me don’t give up
you can do it day by day
and diamonds they don't turn to dust or fade away
so i will keep you day and night here until the day i die
i'll be living one life for the two of us
i will be the best of me always keep you next to me
i'll be living one life for the two of us
even when i'm on my own i know i won't be alone
tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song
i know you'll be looking down swear i'm gonna make you proud
i'll be living one life for the two of us
i could feel your blood run through me
you're written in my dna
looking back in every mirror
i know you'll be waiting i'll see you again
but you once told me don’t give up
you can do it day by day
and diamonds they don't turn to dust or fade away fade away
so i will keep you day and night here until the day i die
i'll be living one life for the two of us
i will be the best of me always keep you next to me
i'll be living one life for the two of us
even when i'm on my own i know i won't be alone
tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song
i know you'll be looking down swear i'm gonna make you proud
i'll be living one life for the two of us
i promised you i'd do this
so all of this is all for you
oh i swear to god you're living
through everything i'll ever do
so i will keep you day and night here until the day i die
i'll be living one life for the two of us
i will be the best of me always keep you next to me
i'll be living one life for the two of us
even when i'm on my own i know i won't be alone
tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song
i know you'll be looking down swear i'm gonna make you proud
i'll be living one life for the two of us
ohohoh ohoh ohohohoh
one life for the two of us
ohohoh ohoh ohohohoh i’ll be living
one life for the two of us
we'll end just like we started
just you and me and no one else
i will hold you where my heart is
one life for the two of us


the first time i tasted somebody else's spit i had a coughing fit
i mistakenly called them by your name
i was let down it wasn't the same
i'm doing fine trying to derail my one track mind
regaining my selfworth in record time
but i can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine
am i a masochist resisting urges to punch you in the teeth
call you a bitch and leave
why did i come here to sit and watch you stare at your feet
what was the plan absolve your guilt and shake hands
i feel no need to forgive but i might as well
but let me kiss your lips so i know how it felt
pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell
don't hold your breath forget you ever saw me at my best
you don't deserve what you don't respect
don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect
now bite your tongue it's too dangerous to fall so young
take back what you said
can't lose what you never had
i feel no need to forgive but i might as well
but let me kiss your lips so i know how it felt
pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell
you got a to so i'll take the night shift
and i'll never see you again if i can help it
in five years i hope the songs feel like covers
dedicated to new lovers
you got a to so i'll take the night shift
and i'll never see you again if i can help it
in five years i hope the songs feel like covers
dedicated to new lovers
you got a to so i'll take the night shift
and i'll never see you again if i can help it
in five years i hope the songs feel like covers

once i was seven years old
my momma told me
go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
once i was seven years old
it was a big big world
but we thought we were bigger
we were learning quicker
by eleven smoking herb
and drinking burning liquor
never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
once i was eleven years old
my daddy told me
go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
once i was eleven years old
i always have that dream
like my daddy before me
i started writing stories
something about that glory
just always seemed to bore me
will ever really know me
once i was twenty years old
my story got told
before the morning sun when life was lonely
once i was twenty years old
i only see my goals
i don't believe in failure
they can make it major
i got my boys with me at least those in favor
i hope i see you later
once i was twenty years old
my story got told
i saw before me
once i was twenty years old
soon we´ll be years old
our songs have been sold
and we´re still roaming
soon we´ll be years old
i´m still learning about life
my woman brought children for me
and i can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me
some are still out seeking glory
my brother i´m still sorry
soon i´ll be sixty years old
my daddy got sixtyone
remember life and then your life
i made a man so happy
when i wrote a letter once
i hope my children come and visit
soon i´ll be sixty years old
will i think the world is cold
or will i have a lot of children who can warm me
soon i´ll be sixty years old
soon i´ll be sixty years old
will i think the world is cold
who can warm me
soon i´ll be sixty years old
once i was seven years old
my momma told me
go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
once i was seven years old
once i was seven years old
there are days
i wake up and i pinch myself
you're with me not someone else
and i am scared yeah i'm still scared
that it's all a dream
'cause you still look perfect as days go by
even the worst ones you make me smile
i'd stop the world if it gave us time
'cause when you love someone
you open up your heart
when you love someone
you make room
if you love someone
and you're not afraid to lose them
you'll probably never love someone like i do
you'll probably never love someone like i do uhh uhh
when you say
you love the way i make you feel
everything becomes so real
don't be scared no don't be scared
'cause you're all i need
and you still look perfect as days go by
even the worst ones you make me smile
i'd stop the world if it gave us time
'cause when you love someone
you open up your heart
when you love someone
you make room
if you love someone
and you're not afraid to lose them
you'll probably never love someone like i do
you'll probably never love someone like i do uhh uhh
all my life
i thought it'd be hard to find
the one 'til i found you
and i find it bittersweet
'cause you gave me something to lose
and when you love someone
you open up your heart
when you love someone
you make room
if you love someone
and you're not afraid to lose them
you'll probably never love someone like i do
you'll probably never love someone like i do
you'll probably never love someone like i do
a hp johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
coke cans and bb guns barbed wire and old fence posts
bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
one arm out the window and one hand on the wheel
some things just go better together and probably always will
like a cup of coffee and a sunrise sunday drives and time to kill
what's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings
or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing
it's a match made up in heaven like good ol' boys and beer
and me as long as you're right here
your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that i got in this house
the way you say "i love you too" is like rain on an old tin roof
and your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove
some things just go better together and probably always will
like a cup of coffee and a sunrise sunday drives and time to kill
what's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings
or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing
it's a match made up in heaven like good ol' boys and beer
and me as long as you're right here
sometimes we're oil and water but i wouldn't have it any other way
and if i'm being honest your first and my last name
would just sound better together and probably always will
like a cup of coffee and a sunrise sunday drives and time to kill
what's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings
or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing
it's a match made up in heaven like good ol' boys and beer
and me as long as you're right here
and me as long as you're right here
sunday morning man she woke up fighting mad
bitchin' and moaning on and on about the time i had
and by tuesday you could say that girl was good as gone
then when thursday came around i was all alone
so i went for a drive to clear my mind and ended up at a shell on
then i won bucks on a scratch off ticket
bought two packs and a tank of gas with it
she swore they were a waste of time aww but she was wrong
i was caller on the radio station
won a day night beach vacation
deep sea senorita fishin' down in panama
i ain't gotta see my exfuture mother in law anymore
oohh lord when it rains it pours
now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
when she heard about my new found luck on the fm dial
and its crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves
what i thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace
its got me thinking that her leavin' is the only logical reason
that i got the last spot in the hooters parking lot
and the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
she picked up on the first ring when i gave her a call
and i only spent bucks at the moose club raffle
won a used fourwheeler and free passes
for me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
i ain't gotta see my exfuture mother in law anymore
oh lord when it rains it pours
when it rains it pours
i've been on one hell of a redneck road for weeks now
it all started on the day that she walked out
then i won bucks on a scratch off ticket
bought two packs and a tank of gas with it
she swore they were a waste of time aww but she was wrong
i was caller on the radio station
won a day night beach vacation
deep sea senorita fishin' down in panama
i ain't gotta see my exfuture mother in law anymore
oohh lord when it rains it pours
when it rains it pours
oh i beg you can i follow
oh i ask you why not always
be the ocean where i unravel
be my only be the water where i'm wading
you're my river running high run deep run wild
i i follow i follow you deep sea baby
i follow you
i i follow i follow you dark doom honey
i follow you

he's the rebel i'm the daughter waiting for you
you're my river running high run deep run wild

i follow you
you're my river running high run deep run wild
i i follow i follow you deep sea baby

spend some time away
getting ready for the day
you're born again
spend some time alone

with better men alone again
alone again alone again
alone again alone
no use looking out
it's within that brings that
lonely feeling
understand when you leave here
among the better men alone again
alone again alone again
alone again alone

why do i deserve the silence to feel better about you
at a loss i lost my cool
i denied that i found you
i tried to be a basket case
i did not surprise you
i'm trying to find a signal fire
let me know when i should move
but you amplified in the silence
justified in the way you make me bruise
magnified in the silence
anatomically proved
that you don't need me
why do i desire the space
i was mourning after you
i was lost and lost my shape
there was nothing i could do
i don't want to waste away
it was all i gave to you
take me back and take my place
i will rise right up for you
but you amplified in the silence
justified in the way you make me bruise
magnified in the silence
anatomically proved
that you don't need me
all the while you waste away you're asking
"did i really need another one to take me down"
everybody knows it's something that you had to live with darling
nobody's gonna tear you down now
there is nothing you keep there is only your reflection
there was nothing but quiet retractions
and families pleading "don't look in that cabinet there's far more bad than there's good
i don't know how it got there"
that was something your father had burned in me
twenty hours out of homestake eternity
"you can go anywhere but you are where you came from"
little girl you are cursed by my ancestry
there is nothing but darkness and agony
i can not only see but you stopped me from blinking
let me watch you as close as a memory
let me hold you above all the misery
let me open my eyes and be glad that i got here
this hit that ice cold michelle pfeiffer that white gold
this one for them hood girls

pushing past the limit
trippin' on hallucinogenics
my cigarette burnt my finger
'cause i forgot i lit it
rippin' with my sinners
'cause fuck it man i ain't no beginner
and then i crawled back to the life that i said i wouldn't live in
'cause i just couldn't open up i'm always shiftin'
go find yourself a man who's strong and tall and christian
pushing past the limit
trippin' on hallucinogenics
my cigarette burnt my finger
'cause i forgot i lit it
drunken in seattle
two more xans and without a paddle
i don't remember your face or your hair or your name or your smile
'cause i just couldn't open up i'm always shiftin'
go find yourself a man who's strong and tall and christian
pushing past the limit
trippin' on hallucinogenics
and then i crawled back to the life that i said i wouldn't live in
'cause i carried on like the wayward son
and now through and through i have come undone
and now i am just but the wayward man
what with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hands
'cause i carried on like the wayward son
and now through and through i have come undone
and now i am just but the wayward man
what with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hands
pushing past the limit
trippin' on hallucinogenics
my cigarette burnt my finger
'cause i forgot i lit it

and we've drunk a couple bottles babe
and set our grief aside
the papers say it's doomsday
the button has been pressed
we're gonna nuke each other up boys
'til old satan stands impressed
and here it is our final night alive
and as the earth burns to the ground oh girl
it's you that i lie with
as the atom bomb locks in
oh it's you i watch tv with
as the world as the world caves in
you put your finest suit on
i paint my fingernails
oh we're going out in style babe
and everything's on sale
we creep up on extinction
i pull your arms right in
i weep and say goodnight love
while my organs pack it in
and here it is our final night alive
and as the earth burns to the ground oh girl
it's you that i lie with
as the atom bomb locks in
oh it's you i watch tv with
as the world as the world caves
oh it's you that i lie with
as the atom bomb locks in
yes it's you i welcome death with
as the world as the world caves in
as the world caves in

i found myself dreaming
in silver and gold
like a scene from a movie
that every broken heart knows
we were walking on moonlight
and you pulled me close
split second and you disappeared
and then i was all alone
i woke up in tears with you by my side
breath of relief
and i realized
no we're not promised tomorrow
so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you like i'm saying goodbye
wherever we're standing
i won't take you for granted
'cause we'll never know when when we'll run out of time
so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
in the blink of an eye
just a whisper of smoke
you could lose everything
the truth is you never know
so i'll kiss you longer baby
any chance that i get
and i'll make the most of the minutes
and love with no regrets
let's take our time to say what we want
use what we got before it's all gone
'cause no we're not promised tomorrow
so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you like i'm saying goodbye
wherever we're standing
i won't take you for granted
'cause we'll never know when when we'll run out of time
so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you like i'm saying goodbye
wherever we're standing
i won't take you for granted
'cause we'll never know when when we'll run out of time
so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you

i took a pill in ibiza
to show avicii i was cool
and when i finally got sober felt years older
but fuck it it was something to do
i'm living out in la
i drive a sports car just to prove
i'm a real big baller cause i made a million dollar
and i spend it on girls and shoes
but you don't wanna be high like me
never really knowing why like me
you don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
you don't wanna ride the bus like this
never knowing who to trust like this
you don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
stuck up on that stage singing
all i know are sad songs sad songs
darling all i know are sad songs sad songs
i'm just a singer who already blew his shot
i get along with old timers
cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
and i can't keep a girl no
cause as soon as the sun comes up
i cut em all loose and work's my excuse
but the truth is i can't open up
but you don't wanna be high like me
never really knowing why like me
you don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
you don't wanna ride the bus like this
never knowing who to trust like this
you don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
stuck up on that stage singing
all i know are sad songs sad songs
darling all i know are sad songs sad songs
i took a plane to my home town
i brought my pride and my guitar
all my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
and the people still think i'm a star
i walked around downtown
i met some fans on lafayette
they said tell us how to make it cause we're getting real impatient
so i looked em in the eye and said
you don't wanna be high like me
never really knowing why like me
you don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
you don't wanna ride the bus like this
never knowing who to trust like this
you don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
stuck up on that stage singing
all that i know are sad songs sad songs
darling all that i know are sad songs sad songs

i want you by my side
so that i never feel alone again
they've always been so kind
but now they've brought you away from here
i hope they didn't get your mind
your heart is too strong anyway
we need to fetch back the time
they have stolen from us
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you've never danced like this before
we don't talk about it
dancin' on do the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
shouldn't talk about it
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you've never danced like this before
we don't talk about it
dancin' on do the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
coldest winter for me
no sun is shining anymore
the only thing i feel is pain
caused by absence of you
suspense is controlling my mind
i cannot find the way out of here
i want you by my side
so that i never feel alone again
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you've never danced like this before
but we don't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
shouldn't talk about it
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you've never danced like this before
but we don't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you've never danced like this before
but we don't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
shouldn't talk about it
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you've never danced like this before
but we don't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
today i will wear my white buttondown
i’m tired of wanting more
i think i’m finally worn
for you have a way of promising things
and i’ve been a forest fire
i am a forest fire
and i am the fire and i am the forest
and i am a witness watching it
i stand in a valley watching it
and you are not there at all
so today i will wear my white buttondown
i can at least be neat
walk out and be seen as clean
and i’ll go to work and i’ll go to sleep
and i’ll love the littler things
i’ll love some littler things
you're growing tired of me
you love me so hard and i still can't sleep
you're growing tired of me
and all the things i don't talk about
sorry i don't want your touch
it's not that i don't want you
sorry i can't take your touch
it's just that i fell in love with a war
nobody told me it ended
and it left a pearl in my hand
and i roll it around
every night just to watch it glow
every night baby that's where i go
sorry i don't want your touch
it's not that i don't want you
sorry i can't take your touch
there's a hole that you fill
you fill you fill
it's just that i fell in love with a war
nobody told me it ended
and it left a pearl in my hand
and i roll it around
every night just to watch it glow
every night baby that's where i go
just to watch it glow
mom i'm tired
can i sleep in your house tonight
mom is it alright
if i stay for a year or two
mom i’ll be quiet
it would be just to sleep at night
and i’ll leave once i figure out
how to pay for my own life too
mom would you wash my back
this once and then we can forget
and i’ll leave what i’m chasing
for the other girls to pursue
mom am i still young
can i dream for a few months more
the black hole
of the
window
where you sleep
the night breeze
carries
something sweet
a peach tree
wild women don't get the blues
but i find that
lately i've been crying like a
tall child
so please hurry leave me
i can't breathe
please don't say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで "mune ga hachi kire sou de"
one word from you
and i would jump off
of this ledge i'm on baby
tell me "don't"
so i can crawl back in
e||
and i was so young
when i behaved twenty five
yet now i find i've grown into
a tall child
and i don't wanna go home yet
let me walk to the top of the big night sky
so please hurry leave me
i can't breathe
please don't say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで "mune ga hachi kire sou de"
one word from you
and i would jump off
of this ledge i'm on baby
tell me "don't"
so i can crawl back in
e||
one word from you
and i would jump off
of this ledge i'm on baby
tell me "don't"
so i can crawl back in
please hurry leave me
i can't breathe
my baby my baby
you’re my baby
say it to me
baby my baby
tell your baby
that i’m your baby
i bet on losing dogs
i know they’re losing
and i pay for my place by the ring
where i’ll be looking in their eyes
when they’re down
i’ll be there on their side
i’m losing by their side
would you let me baby
lose on losing dogs
i know they’re losing
and i pay for my place by the ring
where i’ll be looking in their eyes
when they’re down
i wanna feel it
i bet on losing dogs
i always want you when i’m finally fine
how you’d be over me looking in my eyes
when i cum
someone to watch me die
someone to watch me die
i bet on losing dogs

all of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
apologies from the intercom
and i am relieved that i'd left my room tidy
they'll think of me kindly
when they come for my things
they'll never know how i'd stared at the dark in that room
like a bloodsniffing shark
and while my dreams made music in the night
carefully
i was going to live
you wouldn't leave till we loved in the morning
you'd learned from movies how love ought to be
and you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
but i know through mine you were
looking in yours
and did you know the liberty bell is a replica
silently housed in its original walls
and while its dreams played music in the night
quietly
it was told to believe
i always wanted to die clean and pretty
but i'd be too busy on working days
so i am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
i couldn't have changed anyways
i am relieved that i'd left my room tidy
goodbye
i steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
and then i'll be nothing forever
and all of my memories
and all of the things i have seen will be gone
with my eyes with my body with me
but me and my husband
we are doing better
together
so i bet all i have on that
furrowed brow
and at least in this lifetime
we're sticking together
me and my husband
we're sticking together
and i am the idiot with the painted face
in the corner taking up space
but when he walks in i am loved i am loved
me and my husband
we are doing better
it's always been just him and me
together
so i bet all i have on that
furrowed brow
and at least in this lifetime
we're sticking together
me and my husband
we're sticking together
me and my husband
we are doing better
my god i'm so lonely
so i open the window
to hear sounds of people
to hear sounds of people
venus planet of love
was destroyed by global warming
did its people want too much too
did its people want too much
and i don't want your pity
i just want somebody near me
guess i'm a coward
i just want to feel alright
and i know no one will save me
i just need someone to kiss
give me one good honest kiss
and i'll be alright
nobody nobody nobody
nobody nobody
ooh nobody nobody nobody
i've been big and small and
big and small and
big and small again
and still nobody wants me
still nobody wants me
and i know no one will save me
i'm just asking for a kiss

and i'll be alright
nobody nobody nobody
nobody nobody
ooh nobody nobody
nobody nobody nobody
nobody nobody nobody nobody
nobody nobody nobody nobody
nobody nobody nobody nobody
nobody nobody

toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
baby bang it up inside
i'm not wearing my usual lipstick
i thought maybe we would kiss tonight
baby will you kiss me already and
toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
baby bang it up inside

but do mi ti

if i could i'd be your little spoon
and kiss your fingers forevermore
but big spoon you have so much to do
and i have nothing ahead of me
you're the sun you've never seen the night
but you hear its song from the morning birds
but i'm not the moon i'm not even a star
but awake at night i'll be singing to the birds
don't wait for me i can't go
your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
but i do i think i do
and you're an allamerican boy

but i do i finally do
and you're an allamerican boy

your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me

till someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom

put your faith to the test when i tore off your dress in richmondonhigh

but home was a dream one i’d never seen ‘til you came along
so girl hang your dress up to dry we ain’t leavin’ this room

carries this house on the stones like a piece of driftwood

so girl leave your boots by the bed we ain’t leavin’ this room
til someone needs medical help or the magnolia’s bloom
it’s cold in this house and i ain’t goin’ out to chop wood

sigo cruzando rios andando selvas amando el sol
cada dia sigo sacando espinas de lo profundo del corazon
en la noche sigo encendiendo sueños para limpiar
con el humo sagrado cada recuerdo
cuando escribo tu nombre en la arena blanca con fondo azul
cuando miro al cielo en la forma cruel de una nube gris aparezcas tu
una tarde suba una alta loma mire el pasado
sabras que no te he olvidado
yo te llevo dentro hasta la raiz
y por mas que crezca vas a estar aqui
aunque yo me oculte tras las montañas
y encuentre un campo lleno de caña
no habra manera ni rayo de luna que tu te vayas
ooooooh
pienso que cada instante sobreviviendo al caminar
y cada segundo de insertidumbre cada momento de no saber
son las claves exactas de este tejido que ando cargando
bajo la piel asi te protejo aqui sigues dentro
yo te llevo dentro hasta la raiz
y por mas que crezca vas a estar aqui
aunque yo me oculte tras las montañas
y encuentre un campo lleno de caña
no habra manera ni rayo de luna que tu te vayas
ooooooh
yo te llevo dentro hasta la raiz
y por mas que crezca vas a estar aqui
aunque yo me oculte tras las montañas
y encuentre un campo lleno de caña
no habra manera ni rayo de luna que tu te vayas
esta historia termino no existe
lo que un día construimos se ha esfumado
pareciera que es más fácil dejarnos
pero eres un fantasma conmigo caminando
no creas que no valió la pena
no creas que no eres importante
al contrario yo te ame con toda el alma
no creas que no valió la pena
no creas que lo perdimos
ésto que nos duele aunque nos duele es sólo nuestro
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
fue sólo nuestro
fue sólo nuestro
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
se lo lleva el viento
se lo lleva el viento
esta historia termino no existe
lo que un día construimos se ha esfumado
pareciera que es más fácil dejarnos
pero eres un fantasma conmigo caminando
yo no aprendí a soltar amores
yo no aprendí a dejarte ir
eras una apuesta de largo plazo
lo que construimos
lo que construimos
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
fue sólo nuestro
fue sólo nuestro
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
se lo lleva el viento
se lo lleva el viento
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
fue sólo nuestro
fue sólo nuestro
lo que construimos se acabó
lo que construimos se acabó
se lo lleva el viento
se lo lleva el viento

stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
you missed every call that i had tried so now i'm giving up
a heartbreak in mid december
you don't give a fuck you never remember me
while you're pulling on his jeans
getting lost in the big city
i was looking out our window
watching all the cars go wondering if i'll see chicago
or a sunset on the westcoast
or will i die in the cold
feeling blue and alone
i wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo
i hope you get your ballroom floor
your perfect house with rosered doors
i'm the last thing you remember
i wish i'd known that less is more
but i was passed out on the floor
and that's the last thing i remember
cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
i came out grieving barely breathing and you came out alright
but i'm sure you'll take his hand
i hope he's better than i ever could've been
my mistakes were not intentions
this is a list of my confessions i couldn't say
i hope you get your ballroom floor
your perfect house with rosered doors
i'm the last thing you remember
i wish i'd known that less is more
but i was passed out on the floor
and that's the last thing i remember
i miss your face you're in my head
there's so many things that i should've said
a year of suffering a lesson learned
i miss your face you're in my head
there's so many things that i should've said
a year of suffering a lesson learned
i hope you get your ballroom floor
your perfect house with rosered doors
i'm the last thing you remember
i wish i'd known that less is more
but i was passed out on the floor
and that's the last thing i remember
it's been a long lonely december
hey baby won't you look my way
i can be your new addiction
hey baby what you gotta say
all you're giving me is fiction
i'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
i found out that everybody talks
it started with a whisper
and that was when i kissed her
and then she made my lips hurt
i could hear the chit chat
take me to your love shack
mama's always gotta backtrack
when everybody talks back
hey honey you could be my drug
you could be my new prescription
too much could be an overdose
all this trash talk make me itchin'
oh my mouth yeah everybody talks everybody talks
it started with a whisper
and that was when i kissed her
and then she made my lips hurt
i could hear the chit chat
take me to your love shack
mama's always gotta backtrack
when everybody talks back
never thought i'd live
to see the day
when everybody's words got in the way
hey sugar show me all your love
all you're giving me is friction
hey sugar what you gotta say
it started with a whisper
and that was when i kissed her
and then she made my lips hurt
i could hear the chit chat
take me to your love shack
mama's always gotta backtrack
when everybody talks back
everybody talks everybody talks
everybody talks everybody talks
everybody talks everybody talksback
it started with a whisper
and that was when i kissed her
everybody talks everybody talksback uh
gf
we fight we get high holding on to love
we came down 'cause there was nothing holding us
is it wrong that i still wonder where you are
is it wrong that i still don't know my heart
are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go
are your tears falling down when the lights are low
another friday night tryna put on a show
do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's calling
i've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
put a little love on me
put a little love on me
when the lights come up and there's no shadows dancing
i look around as my heart is collapsing
'cause you're the only one i need
to put a little love on me
we wrote and we wrote 'til there were no more words
we laughed and we cried until we saw our worst
is it wrong that i still wonder where you are
is it wrong that i still don't know my heart
are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go
are your tears falling down when the lights are low
another friday night tryna put on a show
do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's calling
i've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
put a little love on me
put a little love on me
when the lights come up and there's no shadows dancing
i look around as my heart is collapsing
'cause you're the only one i need
to put a little love on me
last night i lay awake
stuck on the things we say
and when i close my eyes the first thing i hear you say is
put a little love on me
put a little love on me
when the lights come up we're the only ones dancing
i look around and you're standing there asking
you say you're the only one i need
so put your love on me
you're the only one i need
so put your love on me
waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
the smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
it’s hard
yesterday i thought i saw your shadow running round
it’s funny how things never change in this old town
so far from the stars
and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now
if the whole world was watching i’d still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
mmmmmmm
i saw that you moved on with someone new
in the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
it’s so hard
so hard
and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now
if the whole world was watching i’d still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
you still make me nervous when you walk in the room
them butterflies they come alive when i’m next to you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
mmmmmmm
and i know that it’s wrong
that i can’t move on
but there’s something about you
if the whole world was watching i’d still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
you still make me nervous when you walk in the room
them butterflies they come alive when i’m next to you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
mmmmmmm
everything comes back to you
mmmmmmm
i've been holding my breath
i've been counting to ten
i've been holding back tears
while you're throwing back beers
you know iii i'm afraid of change
guess that's whyyy we stay the same
so tell me to leave
i'll pack my bags get on the road
find someone that loves you
better than i do darling i know
'cause you remind me every day
i'm not enough but i still stay
feels like a lifetime
just trying to get by while we're dying inside
i've done a lot of things wrong
loving you being one
you know iii i'm afraid of change
guess that's whyyy we stay the same
so tell me to leave
i'll pack my bags get on the road
find someone that loves you
better than i do darling i know
'cause you remind me every day
i'm not enough but i still stay
if you want me to leave
then tell me to leave and baby i'll go
if i had a gun i'd shoot a hole in to the sun
and love would burn this city down for you
if i had the time i'd stop the world and make you mine
and everyday would stay the same with you
aaahhh aaahhh aaahhhhh x
i'd give you back a dream show you now what might of been
if all the tears you cried would fade away
i'll be by your side when they come to say goodbye
we will live to fight another day
excuse me if i've spoke too soon
my eyes have always followed you around the room
cos you're the only god that i will ever need
i'm holding on and waiting for the moment to find me
aaahhh aaahhh aaahhhhh x
hope i didn't speak too soon
my eyes have always followed you around the room
cos you're the only god that i will ever need
i'm holding on and waiting for the moment
for my heart to be unbroken by the sea
aaahhhhhhhh aaahhhhh

my eyes have always followed you around the room
cos you're the only god that i will ever need
i'm holding on and waiting for the moment to find me

jumping up and down the floor
my head is an animal
and once there was an animal
it had a son that mowed the lawn
the son was an ok guy
they had a pet dragonfly
the dragonfly it ran away
but it came back with a story to say
hey
hey
her dirty paws and furry coat
she ran down the forest slope
the forest of talking trees
they used to sing about the birds and the bees
the bees had declared a war
the sky wasn't big enough for them all
the birds they got help from below
from dirty paws and the creatures of snow
hey
hey
and for a while things were cold
they were scared down in their holes
the forest that once was green
was colored black by those killing machines
but she and her furry friends
took down the queen bee and her men
and that's how the story goes
the story of the beast with those four dirty paws
la la la
la la la la

ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore

there's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
well tell her that i miss our little talks

your mind is playing tricks on you my dear
'cause though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore hey

if i could fly i'd be coming right back home to you
i think i might give up everything just ask me to
pay attention i hope that you listen cause i let my guard down
right now i'm completely defenceless
for your eyes only i'll show you my heart
for when you're lonely and forget who you are
i'm missing half of me when we're apart
now you know me for your eyes only
for your eyes only
i've got scars even though they can't always be seen
and pain gets hard but now you're here and i don't feel a thing
pay attention i hope that you listen cause i let my guard down
right now i'm completely defenceless
for your eyes only i'll show you my heart
for when you're lonely and forget who you are
i'm missing half of me when we're apart
now you know me for your eyes only
for your eyes only
i can feel your heart inside of mine i feel it i feel it
i'm going out of my mind i feel it i feel it
know that i'm just wasting time
and i
hope that you don't run from me
for your eyes only i'll show you my heart
for when you're lonely and forget who you are
i'm missing half of me when we're apart
now you know me for your eyes only
for your eyes only i'll show you my heart
for when you're lonely and forget who you are
i'm missing half of me when we're apart
now you know me for your eyes only
for your eyes only
for your eyes only
your hand fits in mine
like it's made just for me
but bear this in mind
it was meant to be
and i'm joining up the dots
with the freckles on your cheeks
and it all makes sense to me
i know you've never loved
the crinkles by your eyes
when you smile
your stomach or your thighs
the dimples in your back
at the bottom of your spine
but i'll love them endlessly
i won't let these little things
slip out of my mouth
but if i do
it's you
oh it's you
they add up to
i'm in love with you
and all these little things
you can’t go to bed
without a cup of tea
and maybe that's the reason
that you talk in your sleep
and all those conversations
are the secrets that i keep
though it makes no sense to me
i know you've never loved
the sound of your voice on
tape you never want to
know how much you weigh
you still have to squeeze
into your jeans
but you're perfect to me
i won't let these little things
slip out of my mouth
but if it's true
it's you
oh it's you
they add up to
i'm in love with you
you'll never love yourself
half as much as i love you
you'll never treat yourself right darlin'
but i want you to
if i let you knooow
i'm here for you
maybe you'll love yourself like i love you oh
and i've just let these little things
slip out of my mouth
'cause it's you
oh it's you
it's you
they add up to
and i'm in love with you
i won't let these little things
slip out of my mouth
but if it's true
it's you
it's you
they add up to
i'm in love with you
and all your little things

going out tonight changes into something red
her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
everything she never had
she’s showing off
driving too fast moon is breaking through her hair
she's heading for something that she won’t forget
having no regrets is all that she really wants
we're only getting older baby
and i've been thinking about it lately
does it ever drive you crazy
just how fast the night changes
everything that you've ever dreamed of
disappearing when you wake up
but there’s nothing to be afraid of
even when the night changes
it will never change me and you
chasing her tonight doubts are running ‘round her head
he’s waiting hides behind his cigarette
heart is beating loud she doesn't want it to stop
moving too fast moon is lighting up her skin
she’s falling doesn't even know it yet
having no regrets is all that she really wants
we're only getting older baby
and i've been thinking about it lately
does it ever drive you crazy
just how fast the night changes
everything that you've ever dreamed of
disappearing when you wake up
but there’s nothing to be afraid of
even when the night changes
it will never change me and you
going out tonight changes into something red
her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost
we're only getting older baby
and i've been thinking about it lately
does it ever drive you crazy
just how fast the night changes
everything that you've ever dreamed of
disappearing when you wake up
but there’s nothing to be afraid of
even when the night changes
everything that you've ever dreamed of
disappearing when you wake up
but there’s nothing to be afraid of
even when the night changes
it will never change baby
we will never change baby
it will never change me and you
i might never be your knight in shining armour
i might never be the one to take home to mother
and i might never be the one who brings you flowers
but i can be the one be the one tonight

i could tell you were curious oh yeah

and if you like midnight driving with the windows down
and if you like going places we can't even pronounce
if you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
baby you're perfect baby you're perfect
so let's start right now
i might never be the hands you've put your heart in
or the arms that hold you any time you want it
but that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
‘cause i can be the one you love from time to time
when i first saw you from across the room
i could tell you were curious oh yeah

i leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
she told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
it seems to me that when i die these words will be written on my stone
and i'll be gone gone tonight
the ground beneath my feet is open wide
the way that i been holdin' on too tight
with nothing in between
the story of my life i take her home
i drive all night to keep her warm
and time
is frozen the story of the story of
the story of my life i give her hope
i spend her love until she's broke inside
the story of my life the story of the story of
written on these walls are the colors that i can't change
leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
i know that in the morning now i'll see us in the light up on the hill
although i am broken my heart is untamed still
and i'll be gone gone tonight

swing my heart across the line

well you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missin' home
only know you love her when you let her go
and you let her go
staring at the bottom of your glass
hoping one day you'll make a dream last
but dreams come slow and they go so fast
you see her when you close your eyes
maybe one day you'll understand why
everything you touch surely dies
but you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missin' home
only know you love her when you let her go
staring at the ceiling in the dark
same old empty feeling in your heart
'cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
well you see her when you fall asleep
but never to touch and never to keep
'cause you loved her too much
and you dived too deep
well you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missin' home
only know you love her when you let her go
and you let her go
ooooo ooooo oooooo
and you let her go
ooooooo ooooo ooooo
and you let her go
'cause you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missin' home
only know you love her when you let her go
'cause you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
je te laisserai des mots
endessous de ta porte
endessous de la lune qui chante
tout près de la place ou tes pieds passent
cachés dans les trous du temps d'hiver
et quand tu es seule pendant un instant
embrassemoi
quand tu voudras
embrassemoi
quand tu voudras
embrassemoi
quand tu voudras

take a seat back in your clamshell
if the oceans not enough nor am i
rollin in i feel a dark swell
crawling up the skin of my spine
if i'd known you sold on maybe
i'd a let you waste another guy
well alrighty aphrodite
go whip that red for other eyes
run your morning bath in sea foam
soak your milky skin in the tide
little pearl you think you're in gold
but i can see the dirt in your lines
if i'd known you sold on maybe
i'd a let you waste another guy
well alrighty aphrodite
go whip that red for other eyes

hey there bud how'd it go last night
i saw you at the band stand looking pretty slammed
did you see me feeding all my drinks to cam
probably not i guess you were quite the mess
and that girl who tagged along there with you
i never caught her name but she seemed fucked up too
from where i sat she looked to be having fun
keeping up with you just like i used to
hey there bud how'd it go last night
i'm sorry to have ditched out but i was pretty high
heard from leslie that on his stumble home
nat was puking up all that beer she'd drunk
though we didn't talk much how'd your evening go
you barely spoke a word to me besides that slurred hello
but i happened to see without even tryin'
how she laughed with you just like i used to
hey there bud how'd it go last night
i woke up to a pair of shoes i've not seen next to mine
did you whisper as you crept in through the door
how you'd never done much like this before
i was thinking back just the other day
remember when we used to sneak out late to go and blaze
seemed like loneliness was all we'd ever do
but now she's knowing you just like i used to

i've heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music do you
well it goes like this
the fourth the fifth the minor fall the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
well your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to the kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
well baby i've been here before
i've seen this room and i've walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
and i've seen your flag on the marble arch
and love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
well maybe there's a god above
but all i've ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

i'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
for a kid a year older than me
and i've been talking to his dad
it makes me so sad
when i think too much about it i can't breathe
and i have this dream where i am screaming underwater
while my friends are all waving from the shore
i don't need you to tell me what that means
i don't believe in that stuff anymore
jesus christ i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have
and i always will
i always have an' always will
and i have a friend i call
when i've bored myself to tears
and we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
but then we laugh until it disappears
last night i blacked out in my car
and i woke up in my childhood bed
wishing i was someone else feeling sorry for myself
and i remembered someone's kid is dead
jesus christ i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have
and i always will
i always have an' always will
and it's again
and i'm doing nothing
again
georgia georgia i love your son
when he gets older he might be the one
he might be the one
georgia georgia he has beautiful bones
and he never lies or picks up his phone
whoa
sometimes in the pouring rain
he'll fall in the mud and get back up again
and if you fiiiiiiiind me
will you knoooooooow me
will you taaaaaaake me
or will you fall
woah
woah
here is my day plan here's my new machine
he's a fine new addition so young and so clean
so young and so clean
he came up through the water without a sound
with my back to the shoreline i dreamt that he drowned
i dreamt that he drowned
sometimes when he looks at me
i know that he needs you you're all that he sees
and if i breaaaaaathe you
will it kiiiiiiill me
will you haaaaaaave me
or watch me faaaaaaaall
if i fiiiiiiix you
will you haaaaaaaate me
would you fuuuuuuuuck this
and let us faaaaaaaall
woah
woah
woah
woah
i hate you for what you did
and i miss you like a little kid
i faked it every time
but that's alright
i can hardly feel anything
i hardly feel anything at all
you gave me fifteen hundred
to see your hypnotherapist
i only went one time
you let it slide
fell on hard times a year ago
was hoping you would let it go and you did
i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out
i'm on the outside looking through
you're throwing rocks around your room
and while you're bleeding on your back
in the glass
i'll be glad that i made it out
and sorry that it all went down like it did
i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out
hey why do you sing with an english accent
i guess it's too late to change it now
you know i'm never gonna let you have it
but i will try to drown you out
you said when you met me you were bored
you said when you met me you were bored
and you you were in a band when i was born
i have emotional motion sickness
i try to stay clean and live without
and i want to know what would happen
if i surrender to the sound

walking scott street feeling like a stranger
with an open heart open container
i've got a stack of mail and a tall can
it's a shower beer it's a payment plan
there's helicopters over my head
every night when i go to bed
spending money and i earned it
when i'm lonely that's when i'll burn it
do you feel ashaaaa aamed
when you hear my naaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaame
i asked you "how is your sister
i heard she got her degree"
and i said "that makes me feel old"
he said "what does that make me"
i asked you "how is playing drums"
you said it's too much shit to carry
"and what about the band"
you said they're all getting married
do you feel ashaaaa aaaaaamed
when you hear my naaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaame
anyway don't be a stranger
anyway don't be a stranger
don't be a stranger


wandering the streets all through the night
searching for the one to make me right
wondering if she's the shade of you
and if so should i try to see it through
e|x|

silver and gold
new desire
friends on fire
strawberry stained fingertips chain smoking bingewatching netflix
bike grease in my hair blood on your
jeans blisters on your feet a huge grin full of teeth
the california drought the smell after the thunderstorm
that knocked the power out sweat soaks up my handle bars
i want to die with all my scars if they don’t like the way we are then fuck em'
and i stayed up chain smoking in the kitchen until you got home
and the curtains were on fire fuck i'm sorry you feel all alone
with the tv blasting shadows on my face
hitching back to the apartment it was such a lonely place
i place my head between my knees and think
do you ever have nights like these
so separated from my sense of self
and the shit you keep up on your bookshelf
so i just take another sip i keep falling off and eating shit
and forgetting to unclip the sun will rise another time
for now it’s me and you our bikes we trip and stumble laughing to the park
the flea bites laid out on my wrist the heart shaped blister on my palm
the handlebars had etched my body is out on my back porch
my brain is fucking somewhere else on the roof with the flags we torched
and i stayed up chain smoking in the kitchen until you got home
and the curtains were on fire fuck i'm sorry you feel all alone
with the tv blasting shadows on my face
hitching back to the apartment it was such a lonely place
i place my head between my knees and think
do you ever have nights like these
so separated from my sense of self
and the shit you keep up on your bookshelf
she said "baby i'm afraid to fall in love
'cause what if it's not reciprocated"
i told her "don't rush girl dont you rush
guess it's all a game of patience"
she said "what if i dive deep
will you come in after me
would you share your flaws with me let me know"
i told her "thinking is all wrong
love will happen when it wants
i know it hurts sometimes but don't let it go"
'cause i want you i want you
i want i want you
'cause i want you i want you
i want i want you
she said "what if i tell you all the things i've done
would you run away from me"
i told her "baby we all got bags full of shit that we don't want
but i can unpack it for you baby"
she said "what if i dive deep
will you come in after me
would you share your flaws with me let me know"
i told her "thinking is all wrong
love will happen when it wants
i know it hurts sometimes but don't let it go"
'cause i want you i want you
i want i want you
'cause i want you i want you
i want i want you
i want you i want you
i want you yeah
my head is stuck in the clouds
she begs me to come down
says "boy quit foolin' around"
i told her "i love the view from up here
the warm sun and wind in my ear
we'll watch the world from above
as it turns to the rhythm of love"
we may only have tonight
but till the morning sun you're mine all mine
play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
my heart beats like a drum
a guitar string to the strum
a beautiful song to be sung
she's got blue eyes deep like the sea
that roll back when she's laughing at me
she rises up like the tide
the moment her lips meet mine
we may only have tonight
but till the morning sun you're mine all mine
play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
when the moon is low
we can dance in slow motion
and all your tears will subside
all your tearswill dry
bahbahbaba bah bah – bahbahbaba bah bah
daaah – dada dum da da dum
bahbahbaba bah bah – bahbahbaba bah bah
daaah – dada dum da da dum
and long after i've gone
you'll still be humming along
and i will keep you in my mind
the way you make love so fine
we may only have tonight
but till the morning sun you're mine all mine
play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
ohh
play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
yeah sway to the rhythm of love
e|||||
right from the start
you were a thief you stole my heart
and i your willing victim
i let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
and with every touch you fixed them
now you've been talking in your sleep oh oh
things you never say to me oh oh
tell me that you've had enough
of our love our love
just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
just a second we're not broken just bent
and we can learn to love again
it's in the stars it's been written in the scars on our hearts
we're not broken just bent
and we can learn to love again
i'm sorry i don't understand where all of this is coming from
i thought that we were fine
your head is running wild again my dear we still have everything
and it's all in your mind
you've been having real bad dreams oh oh
you used to lie so close to me oh oh
there's nothing more than empty sheets
between our love our love oh our love our love
just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
just a second we're not broken just bent
and we can learn to love again
i never stopped you're still written in the scars on my heart
you're not broken just bent
and we can learn to love again
oh tear ducts and rust
i'll fix it for us
we're collecting dust but our love's enough
you're holding it in you're pouring a drink
no nothing is as bad as it seems
just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
just a second we're not broken just bent
and we can learn to love again
it's in the stars it's been written in the scars on our hearts
that we're not broken just bent
and we can learn to love again
ohhohh we can learn to love again
ohhohh we can learn to love again
ohh
that we're not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
ever wonder about what he's doing
how it all turned to lies
sometimes i think that it's better
to never ask why
where there is desire
there is gonna be a flame
where there is a flame
someone's bound to get burned
but just because it burns
doesn't mean you're gonna die
you've gotta get up and try try try
gotta get up and try try try
you gotta get up and try try
try
funny how the heart can be deceiving
more than just a couple times
why do we fall in love so easy
even when it's not right
where there is desire
there is gonna be a flame
where there is a flame
someone's bound to get burned
but just because it burns
doesn't mean you're gonna die
you've gotta get up and try try try
gotta get up and try try try
you gotta get up and try try
try
ever worried that it might be ruined
and does it make you wanna cry
when you're out there doing what you're doing
are you just getting by
tell me are you just getting by by by
where there is desire
there is gonna be a flame
where there is a flame
someone's bound to get burned
but just because it burns
doesn't mean you're gonna die
you've gotta get up and try try try
gotta get up and try try try
you gotta get up and try try try
gotta get up and try try try
you gotta get up and try try try
gotta get up and try try try
you gotta get up and try try

gotta get up and try try try

and i ain't seen the light of day since well that's not important
it's been long
and i was feeling whitney me and my homies sip like houston
cars and clothes thought i was winning you knew i was losing
you told me to wake up oh my clock always stays on snooze
and i'm done
to each their own and found peace in knowing
ain't always broken but here's to hoping
show no emotion against your coding
and just act as hard as you can
you don't need a friend
oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
oo oo
and i've been looking for someone that i can buy my drugs from
it seems like every plug ran east to utah became mormons
drought comes around feels like i have no one to depend on
sober ugh

i put on a little dwight and sang a happy tune
and lit a cigarette stepped out the door had an appearance
drank more
to each their own and found peace in knowing
ain't always broken but here's to hoping
show no emotion against your coding
just act as hard as you can
you don't need a friend
oo oo oo oo oo oo oo

coming out to the light of day
we got many moons than a deeper place
so i keep an eye on the shadows smile
to see what it has to say
you and i both know
everything must go away
oh what do you say
spinning off head is on my heart
it's like a bit of light and a touch of dark
you got sneak attacked from the zodiac
but i see your eyes spark
keep the breeze and go
blow by blow and go away
oh what do you say
you don't know my mind
you don't know my kind
dark necessities are part of my design
tell the world that i'm falling from the sky
dark necessities are part of my design
stumble down to the parking lot
you got no time for the afterthought
they're like ice cream for an astronaut
well that's me looking for weed
turn the corner and
find the world and show command
playing the hand
you don't know my mind
you don't know my kind
dark necessities are part of my design
tell the world that i'm falling from the sky
dark necessities are part of my design
do you want this love of mine
the darkness helps to sort the shine
do you want it do you want it now
do you want it overtime
the darkness helps to sort the shine
do you want it do you want it now
pick you up like a paperback
with the track record of a maniac
so i'm moving in and we unpack
it's the same as yesterday
honey where we roll
everything must go away
oh what do you say
you don't know my mind
you don't know my kind
dark necessities are part of my design
tell the world that i'm falling from the sky
dark necessities are part of my design


come set your rule and reign
in our hearts again
increase in us we pray
unveil why we're made
come set our hearts ablaze with hope
like wild fire in our very soul
holy spirit come invade us now
we are your church
and we pray revive
on earth
we seek your kingdom first
we hunger and we thirst
refuse to waste our lives
for you're our joy and prize
to see the captive hearts released
the hurt the sick the poor at peace
we lay down our lives for heaven's cause
we are your church
and we need your power
in us
build your kingdom here
let the darkness fear
show your mighty hand
heal our streets and land
set your church on fire
win this nation back
change the atmosphere
build your kingdom here
we pray
unleash your kingdom's power
reaching the near and far
no force of hell can stop
your beauty changing hearts
you made us for much more than this
awake the kingdom seed in us
fill us with the strength and love of christ
we are your church
we are the hope
on earth
build your kingdom here
let the darkness fear
show your mighty hand
heal our streets and land
set your church on fire
win this nation back
change the atmosphere
build your kingdom here
we pray
build your kingdom here
let the darkness fear
show your mighty hand
heal our streets and land
set your church on fire
win this nation back
change the atmosphere
build your kingdom here
we pray
i should have stayed at home
'cause right now i see all these people that love me but i still feel alone
can't help but check my phone
i could have made you mine
but no it wasn't meant to be and see i wasn't made for you and you weren't made for me
though it seemed so easy
and that's because i wanna be your favourite boy
i wanna be the one that makes your day
the one you think about as you lie awake
i can't wait to be your number one
i'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
but i still wanna break your heart and make you cry
but won't you wait
you know it's too late
i'm on my own shit now
let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
i feel great
woah oh oh oh oh
you need to be yourself
love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool that makes your heart melt
who knows what you truly felt
you're still my favourite girl
you better trust me when i tell you there ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world
in this damn world
you're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
you're gonna wanna be my best friend
you're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
you're gonna wanna be my best friend
you're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
you're gonna wanna be my best friend
you're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
you're gonna wanna be my best friend
i say that i'm happy

and i'll be the one
that will love you
the way i'm supposed to girl
but will you still love me
when nobody wants me around
when i turn and forget things

proud of me of my short list of accomplishments
me and my lack of new news
me and my selfishness
or me and myself wish you nothing but a happy new version of you
cause i
i want you to tell me you find it hard to be yourself so i can say"it's gonna be alright"
and i want you to love me the way you love your family

yeah loving is easy
when everything's perfect
please don't change a single little thing for me

when you can't even hide it
and it didn't take forever to find it
i was all on my own
almost glad to be alone
until love came in on time on time
so loving is easy

yeah loving is easy
when everything's perfect
please don't change a single little thing for me

oh oh

the great protector
is that what i'm supposed to be
what if all this counts for nothing
everything i thought i'd be
what if by the time i realize
it's too far behind to see
seventymil projector
i can show you everything yeah
and we're on our way to glory
where the show won't ever end
and the encore lasts forever
and it's time we're due to spend
spending the years together
growing older every day every day
i feel at home when i'm around you
and i'll gladly say again
i hope the encore lasts forever
now there's time for us to spend
and it's sublime with you my friend
this right here still feels like a honeymoon
when you say my name nothing's changed
i'm still a boy inside my thoughts
am i meant to understand my faults
i don't think so
i don't think i'm meant to understand myself
maybe you do
maybe in time
maybe one day
i'll do the same
ooo ooo ooo
i'll do the same
i'll do the same
i'll do the
same
i'll do the same as you
i'll try and hold it up
soon i hope
or as soon as i'm old enough
old enough to understand
old enough to understand
stay forever you know more than anyone yeah whoa
and it's you that knows my darkness
you could blast me and my secrets
because there's probably just no need
woah oh
i want to know
where i can go
when you're not around
and i'm feeling down
so won't you stay for a moment
so i can say
i i need you so
cause right now you know that nothing is new
and i'm obsessed with you
then i fell to the ground
i don't wanna see you crying
you don't have to feel this emptiness
she said i love you till the day that i die
maybe she's right
cause i don't wanna feel like i'm not me
and to be honest i don't even know why
i let myself get down in the first place
i'm trying to keep my mind at bay
sunflowers still grows at night
waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
make it down down dodown down
make it dodown du du du
waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
you know you need to get yourself to sleep
and dream a dream of you and i
there's no need to keep an open eye
just let me hold you in these arms tonight
you can see it in my face
but when i fucked my shit up too many times
why would i let myself get down in the first place
i'm trying to keep my mind at bay
sunflowers still grows at night
waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
make it down down dodown down
make it dodown du du du
waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
and so she sat me down and told me that i didn't have to cry
said i didn't need to get down and feel empty inside
and told me that she love me for as long as she's alive
and well maybe she's right cause i hate it when i feel like i'm not me
see i honestly don't even know why
i i honestly don't even know why
i'm trying to keep my mind at bay
sunflowers still grows at night
waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
make it down down dodown down
make it dodown du du du
waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
i don't really give a damn about the way you touch me when we're alone
you can hold my hand if no one's home
do you like it when i'm away
if i went and hurt my body baby would you love me the same
i can feel all my bones coming back and i'm craving motion
mama never really learned how to live by herself
it's a curse and it's growing you're a pond and i'm an ocean
all my emotions feel like explosions when you are around
and i've found a way to kill the sound
oh baby i am a wreck when i'm without you
i need you here to stay
i broke all my bones that day i found you
crying at the lake
was it something i said to make you feel like you're a burden
oh and if i could take it all back i swear that i would pull you from the tide
oh woah woah woah i said no
i said no
listen close it's a no
the wind is a'poundin' on my back
and i've found hope in a heart attack
oh at last it is passed
now i've got it and you can't have it
oh baby i am a wreck when i'm without you
i need you here to stay
i broke all my bones that day i found you
crying at the lake
was it something i said to make you feel like you're a burden
oh and if i could take it all back i swear that i would pull you from the
tiiiiiiiide oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
darlin when i'm fast asleep i've seen this person watching me sayin
"is it worth it is it worth it tell me is it worth it"
ohhhhhhh cause there is something and there is nothing
there is nothing in between
and in my eyes there is a tiny dancer watching over me
he's singin' "she's a she's a lady" and i am just a boy
he's singing "she's a she's a lady" and i am just a line without a hook
oh baby i am a wreck when i'm without you
i need you here to stay
i broke all my bones that day i found you
crying at the lake
was it something i said to make you feel like you're a burden
oh and if i could take it all back i swear that i would pull you from the tide
i'm headed straight for the floor
the alcohol's served its tour
and it's headed straight for my skin
leaving me daft and dim
i've got this shake in my legs
shaking the thoughts from my head
but who put these waves in the door
i crack and out
i pour
i'm mr loverman
and i miss my lover man
i'm mr loverman
oh and i miss my lover
the ways in which you talk to me
have me wishing i were gone
the ways that you say my name
have me runnning on and on
oh i'm cramping up
i'm cramping up
but you're cracking up
you're cracking up
i'm mr loverman
and i miss my lover man
i'm mr loverman
oh and i miss my lover
i'm shattered now
i'm spilling out
upon this linoleum ground
i'm reeling in my brain again
before it can get back to you
oh what am i 'spose to do
without you
i'm mr loverman
and i miss my lover man
i'm mr loverman
oh and i miss my lover
i'm mr loverman
and i miss my lover man
i'm mr loverman
oh and i miss my lover

there was a time
when i was alone
nowhere to go
and no place to call home
my only friend was the man in the moon
and even sometimes he would go away too
then one night as i close my eyes
i saw a shadow flying high
he came to me
with the sweetest smile
told me he wanted to talk for awhile
he said peter pan that's what they call me
i promise that you'll never be lonely
and ever since that day
i am a lost boy from neverland
usually hanging out with peter pan
and when we're bored we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook
run run lost boy they say to me
away from all of reality
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
he sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
believe in him and believe in me
together we will fly away in a cloud of green
to your beautiful destiny
as we soared above the town that never loved me
i realized i finally had a family
soon enough we reached neverland
peacefully my feet hit the sand
and ever since that day
i am a lost boy from neverland
usually hangin' out with peter pan
and when we're bored we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook
run run lost boy they say to me
away from all of reality
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
peter pan tinkerbell wendy darling
even captain hook you are my perfect storybook
neverland i love you so you are now my home sweet home
forever a lost boy at last
and for always i will say
i am a lost boy from neverland
usually hangin' out with peter pan
and when we're bored we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook
run run lost boy they say to me
away from all of reality
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free

covering their old heartbreaks with new tattoos

looking through low lights at silhouettes

you and me we made a vow
for better or for worse
i can't believe you let me down
but the proof is in the way it hurts
for months on end i've had my doubts
denying every tear
i wish this would be over now
but i know that i still need you here
you say i'm crazy
cause you don't think i know what you've done
but when you call me baby
i know i'm not the only one
you've been so unavailable
now sadly i know why
your heart is unobtainable
even though lord knows you have mine
you say i'm crazy
cause you don't think i know what you've done
but when you call me baby
i know i'm not the only one
i have loved you for many years
maybe i am just not enough
you've made me realise my deepest fear
by lying and tearing us up
you say i'm crazy
cause you don't think i know what you've done
but when you call me baby
i know i'm not the only one
you say i'm crazy
cause you don't think i know what you've done
but when you call me baby
i know i'm not the only one
i know i'm not the only one
i know i'm not the only one
and i know and i know and i know and i know
and i know and i know know
i know i'm not the only one
yes i do i believe
right there right next to you
your touch your skin where do i begin
no words can explain the way i'm missing you
you told me not to cry when you were gone
but the feelings overwhelming it's much too strong
can i lay by your side next to you you
and make sure you're alright
i'll take care of you
and i don't want to be here if i can't be with you tonight
i'm reaching out to you
can you hear my call
this hurt that i've been through
i'm missing you missing you like crazy
you told me not to cry when you were gone
but the feelings overwhelming it's much too strong
can i lay by your side next to you you
and make sure you're alright
i'll take care of you
and i don't want to be here if i can't be with you tonight
lay me down tonight
lay me by your side
lay me down tonight
lay me by your side
can i lay by your side next to you you
he could be a sinner or a gentleman
he could be a preacher when your soul is damned
he could be a lawyer on a witness stand but
he'll never love you like i can can
he could be a stranger you gave a second glance
he could be a trophy of a one night stand
he could have your humor but i don't understand cause
he'll never love you like i can can can
why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
there may be lovers who hold out their hands but
they'll never love you like i can can can
they'll never love you like i can can
a chance encounter of circumstance
maybe he’s a mantra keeps your mind entranced
he could be the silence in this mayhem but then again
he'll never love you like i can can can
why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
there may be lovers who hold out their hands but
they'll never love you like i can can can
they'll never love you like i can can can
he'll never love you like i can can can
we both have demons that we can't stand
i love your demons like devils can
if you’re selfseeking an honest man
then stop deceiving lord please
why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
there may be lovers who hold out their hands but
they'll never love you like i can can can
they'll never love you like i can can can
he'll never love you like i can can can
guess it's true i'm not good at a onenight stand
but i still need love cause i'm just a man
these nights never seem to go to plan
i don't want you to leave will you hold my hand
won't you stay with me

i'm never gonna let you close to me
even though you mean the most to me
'cause every time i open up it hurts
so i'm never gonna get too close to you
even when i mean the most to you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt
every time you hurt me the less that i cry
and every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out the less i love you
baby we don't stand a chance it's sad but it's true
i'm way too good at goodbyes i'm way too good at goodbyes
i'm way too good at goodbyes i'm way too good at goodbyes
i know you're thinking i'm heartless
i know you're thinking i'm cold

even though you mean the most to me
'cause every time i open up it hurts
so i'm never gonna get too close to you
even when i mean the most to you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt
every time you hurt me the less that i cry
and every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out the less i love you
baby we don't stand a chance it's sad but it's true
i'm way too good at goodbyes i'm way too good at goodbyes
i'm way too good at goodbyes i'm way too good at goodbyes
no way that you'll see me cry no way that you'll see me cry
i'm way too good at goodbyes i'm way too good at goodbyes

every time you hurt me the less that i cry
and every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out the less i love you
baby we don't stand a chance it's sad but it's true
i've been here before
but always hit the floor
i've spent a lifetime running
and i always get away
but with you i'm feeling something
that makes me want to stay
i'm prepared for this
i never shoot to miss
but i feel like a storm is coming
if i'm gonna make it through the day
then there's no more use in running
this is something i gotta face
if i risk it all
could you break my fall
how do i live how do i breathe
when you're not here i'm suffocating
i want to feel love run through my blood
tell me is this where i give it all up
for you i have to risk it aall
cause the writing's on the wall
a million shards of glass
that haunt me from my past
as the stars begin to gather
and the light begins to fade
when all hope begins to shatter
know that i won't be afraid
if i risk it all
could you break my fall
how do i live how do i breathe
when you're not here i'm suffocating
i want to feel love run through my blood
tell me is this where i give it all up
for you i have to risk it aall
cause the writing's on the waaaall
the writing's on the waaaaall
how do i live how do i breathe
when you're not here i'm suffocating
i want to feel love run through my blood
tell me is this where i give it all up
how do i live how do i breathe
when you're not here i'm suffocating
i want to feel love run through my blood
tell me is this where i give it all up
for you i have to risk it aall
cause the writing's on the wall
it's not simple to say
that most days i don't recognize me
that these shoes and this apron
have taken more than i gave them
it's not easy to know
i'm not anything that i used to be although
it's true i was never attention's sweet center
i still remember that girl
she's imperfect but she tries
she is good but she lies
she is hard on herself
she is broken and won't ask for help
she is messy but she's kind
she is lonely most of the time
she is all of this mixed up and
baked in a beautiful pie
she is gone but she used to be mine
and it's not what i asked for
sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor
and carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true
and you're not what i asked for
if i'm honest i know i would give it all back
for a chance to start over
and rewrite an ending or two
who'd be reckless just enough
who'd get hurt but who learns how to toughen up
when she's bruised and gets used
by a man who can't love
and be scared of the life that's inside her
growing stronger each day
to fight just a little
to bring back the fire in her eyes
that's been gone but used to be mine
used to be mine
she is messy but she's kind
she is lonely most of the time
she is all of this mixed up
and baked in a beautiful pie
she is gone but she used to be mine
yelling at the sky
screaming at the world
baby why'd you go away
i'm still your girl
holding on too tight
head up in the clouds
heaven only knows where you are now
how do i love how do i love again
how do i trust how do i trust again
i stay up all night tell myself i'm alright
baby you're just harder to see than most
i put the record on wait 'til i hear our song
every night i'm dancing with your ghost
every night i'm dancing with your ghost
never got the chance
to say a last goodbye
i gotta move on
but it hurts to try
how do i love how do i love again
how do i trust how do i trust again
i stay up all night tell myself i'm alright
baby you're just harder to see than most
i put the record on wait 'til i hear our song
every night i'm dancing with your ghost
every night i'm dancing with your ghost
how do i love how do i love again
how do i trust how do i trust again
i stay up all night tell myself i'm alright
baby you're just harder to see than most
i put the record on wait 'til i hear our song
every night i'm dancing with your ghost
every night i'm dancing with your ghost
every night i'm dancing with your ghost
the birds have left their trees
the light pours onto me
i can feel you lying there
all on your own
we got here the hard way
all those words that we exchanged
is it any wonder things get brooooooke
'cause in my heart and in my head

but i know that i'll make it out alive
if i quit calling you my lover

and now that i'm without your kisses
i'll be needing stitches
tripping over myself aching
begging you to come help
and now that i'm without your kisses
i'll be needing stitches
just like a moth drawn to a flame
oh you lured me in i couldn't sense the pain
your bitter heart cold to the touch
now i'm gonna reap what i sow
i'm left seeing red on my own
got a feeling that i'm going under
but i know that i'll make it out alive
if i quit calling you my lover

you watch me bleed until i can't breathe
i'm shaking falling onto my knees
and now that i'm without your kisses

i wanna follow where she goes
i think about her and she knows it
i wanna let it take control
'cause everytime that she gets closer
she pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
and maybe i should stop and start confessing
confessing
oh i've been shaking
i love you when you go crazy
you take all my inhibitions
baby there's nothing holding me back
you take me places that tear up my reputation
manipulate my decisions
baby there's nothing holding me back
there's nothing holding me back
there's nothing holding me back
she says that she is never afraid
just picture everybody naked
she really doesn't like to wait
not really into hesitation
she pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
and maybe i should stop and start confessing
confessing
oh i've been shaking
i love you when you go crazy
you take all my inhibitions
baby there's nothing holding me back
you take me places that tear up my reputation
manipulate my decisions
baby there's nothing holding me back
there's nothing holding me back
there's nothing holding me back
'cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
i know we'd be alright i know we would be alright
'cause if you are by my side and we stumbled in the dark
i know we'd be alright i know we'd be alright
'cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
i know we'd be alright i know we'd be alright
'cause if you are by my side and we stumbled in the dark
i know we'd be alright i know we'd be alright

and you can tell me if i'm off
but i see it on your face
when you say that he's the one that you want
and you're spending all your time
in this wrong situation
and anytime you want it to stop
i know i can treat you better
than he can
and any girl like you deserves a gentleman
tell me why are we wasting time
on all on your wasted crying
when you should be with me instead
i know i can treat you better
better than he can
i'll stop time for you
the second you say you'd like me to
i just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
baby just to wake up with you
could be everything i need and this could be so different
tell me what you want to do
cause i know i can treat you better
than he can
and any girl like you deserves a gentleman
tell me why are we wasting time
on all on your wasted crying
when you should be with me instead
i know i can treat you better
better than he can

e|||||||||
i've waited a hundred years
i'd wait a million more for you
nothing prepared me for
what the privilege of being yours
would do
if i had only felt
the warmth within your touch
if i had only seen
how you smile when you blush
or how you curl your lip
when you concentrate enough
i would have known
what i was living for all along
what i've been living for
your love is my turning page
where only the sweetest words remain
every kiss is a cursive line
every touch is a redefined phrase
i surrender who i've been
for who you are
nothing makes me stronger than
your fragile heart
if i had only felt how it feels
to be yours
then i would have known
what i've been living for all along
what i've been living for
though we're tethered
to the story we must tell
when i saw you
well i knew we'd tell it well
with a whisper
we will tame the vicious seas
like a feather
something bad is 'bout to happen to me
i don't know it but i feel it comin'
might be so sad might leave my nose running
i just hope she don't wanna leave me
don't you give me up please don't give up
honey i belong with you and only you baby
only you my girl only you babe
only you darling only you babe
only you my girl only you babe
only you darling only you
something bad is 'bout to happen to me
why i feel this way i don't know maybe
i think of her so much it drives me crazy
i just don't want her to leave me
don't you give me up please don't give up
honey i belong with you and only you baby
only you my girl only you babe
only you darling only you babe
only you my girl only you babe
only you darling only you

what if
she's fine
it's my mind that's wrong
and i just
let bad thoughts
linger for far too long
what if if
she’s fine fine
it’s my mind that’s wrong
and i just just
let bad thoughts thoughts
linger for far too long
don't you give me up please don't give up
honey i belong with you and only you baby
only you my girl only you babe
only you darling only you babe
only you my girl only you babe
only you darling only you
the evil it spread like a fever ahead
it was night when you died my firefly
what could i have said to raise you from the dead
oh could i be the sky on the fourth of july
well you do enough talk
my little hawk why do you cry
tell me what did you learn from the tillamook burn
or the fourth of july
we’re all gonna die
sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
was it all a disguise like junior high
where everything was fiction future and prediction
now where am i my fading supply
did you get enough love
my little dove why do you cry
and i’m sorry i left but it was for the best
though it never felt right
my little versailles
the hospital asked should the body be cast
before i say goodbye my star in the sky
such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
do you find it all right my dragonfly
shall we look at the moon
my little loon why do you cry
make the most of your life while it is rife
while it is light
well you do enough talk
my little hawk why do you cry
tell me what did you learn from the tillamook burn
or the fourth of july
we’re all gonna die
we’re all gonna die
we’re all gonna die
we’re all gonna die
oh to see without my eyes
the first time that you kissed me
boundless by the time i cried
i built your walls around me
white noise what an awful sound
fumbling by rogue river
feel my feet above the ground
hand of god deliver me
oh oh woeohwoah is me
the first time that you touched me
oh will wonders ever cease
blessed be the mystery of love
lord i no longer believe
drowned in living waters
cursed by the love that i received
from my brother's daughter
like hephaestion who died
alexander's lover
now my riverbed has dried
shall i find no other
oh oh woeohwoah is me
i'm running like a plover
now i'm prone to misery
the birthmark on your shoulder reminds me
how much sorrow can i take
blackbird on my shoulder
and what difference does it make
when this love is over
shall i sleep within your bed
river of unhappiness
hold your hands upon my head
till i breathe my last breath
oh oh woeohwoah is me
the last time that you touched me
oh will wonders ever cease
blessed be the mystery of love
no this is not the time or the place for broken hearted
cause this is the end of the rainbow
no i don’t wanna leave but i must keep moving ahead
cause my life belongs to the other side

don't kill me just help me run away
from everyone i need a place to stay
where i can cover up my face
don't cry i am just a freak
i am just a freak
i am just a freak
i am just a freak
my head is filled with parasites
black holes cover up my eyes
i dream of you almost every night
hopefully i won't wake up this time
i won't wake up this time
i won't wake up this time
i won't wake up this time

cold bones yeah that’s my love
she hides away like a ghost
ooh does she know that we bleed the same
ooh don’t wanna cry but i break that way
cold sheets but where’s my love
i am searching high i’m searching low in the night
ooh does she know that we bleed the same
ooh don’t wanna cry but i break that way
did she run away did she run away i don’t know
if she ran away if she ran away come back home
i got a fear oh in my blood
she was carried up into the clouds high above
ooh if you bled i bleed the same
ooh if you’re scared i’m on my way
did you run away did you run away i don’t need to know
if you ran away if you ran away come back home
something hides in every night
brings desire from the deep
and with it comes a burning light
to keep us from our sleep
and as the full star tries his best to make the white pearl shine
glances of a new day have arrived
and though he's not alone he fears to never love another
and leave his heart forever with her smile
ha
habibi light is burning
as i am burning
habibi light is burning
as i am yearning
something died within a soul
left the eyes to rust
and every time it is recalled
it covers all in dust
habibi light is burning
as i am burning
habibi light is burning
as i am yearning
and meanwhile a whole lot goes down
somewhere in the darkness us together for a while
you loved it then so did i
a feeling deep inside you wants to love it all again
now don't leave it there just give it a chance
if only i'd forget you after one last dance
but you're everywhere yes you are
in every melody and in every little scar
yes you are you are
habibi light is burning
as i am burning
habibi light is burning
and i am yearning
it feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
and make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh
it feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
to fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
yeaaaah
we're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
it's miserable and magical oh yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
it's time uh uh
i don't know about you but i'm feeling twentytwo
everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
you don't know about me but i bet you want to
everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
twentytwooooo twentytwooooo
it seems like one of those nights
this place is too crowded
too many cool kids uh uh uh uh
it seems like one of those nights
we ditch the whole scene
and end up dreaming instead of sleeping
yeaaaah
we're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
it's miserable and magical oh yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
it's time uh uh
i don't know about you but i'm feeling twentytwo
everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
you don't know about me but i bet you want to
everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
twentytwooooo twentytwooooo
i don't know about you twentytwooooo twentytwoooo
it feels like one of those nights
we ditch the whole scene
it feels like one of those nights
we won't be sleeping
it feels like one of those nights
you look like bad news
i gotta have you i gotta have you
oh oh yeah yeah
i don't know about you but i'm feeling twentytwo
everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
you don't know about me but i bet you want to
everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're

dancing like twentytwooooo yeah twentytwooooo yeah yeah
it feels like one of those nights
we ditch the whole scene
it feels like one of those nights
we won't be sleeping
it feels like one of those nights
you look like bad news
i gotta have you i gotta have you
i walked through the door with you the air was cold
but something 'bout it felt like home somehow and i
left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you still got it in your drawer even now
oh your sweet dispositon and my wide eyed gaze
we're singing in the car getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay but i'm not fine at all oh oh oh
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well
photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tball team
you tell me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me
and i know it's long gone and it was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to
'cause here we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well
maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
running scared i was there i remember it all too well
hey you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lyin' here
cause i remember it all all all too well
time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still tryin' to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah
'cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare i was there i remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
down the stairs you were there you remember it all
it was rare i was there i remember it all too well
i'm so glad you made time to see me
how's life tell me how's your family
i haven't seen them in a while
you've been good busier than ever
we small talk work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why
cause the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die
so this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you
saying i'm sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time
these days i haven't been sleeping
staying up playing back myself leaving
when your birthday passed and i didn't call
then i think about summer all the beautiful times
i watched you laughing from the passenger side
and realized i loved you in the fall
and when the cold came the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love
and all i gave you was goodbye
so this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you
saying i'm sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
wishing that i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
i miss your tan skin and your sweet smile
so good to me so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again i swear i'd love you right
i'd go back in time and change it but i can't
so if the chain is on your door i understand
but this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you
saying i'm sorry for that night
and i go back to december comp in
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
wishing that i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december turn around and make it alright
i go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
all the time
took a deep breath in the mirror
he didn’t like it when i wore high heels but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didn’t get this song but i do i do
walked in expecting you’d be late
but you got here early
and you stand and wait
i walk to you
you pulled my chair out and helped me in
and you don’t know how nice that is
but i do
and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it’s strange that you think i’m funny ‘cause he never did
i’ve been spending the last months thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
you said you never met one girl who
has as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you don’t know why i’m coming off a little shy
but i do
but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it’s strange that you think i’m funny ‘cause he never did
i’ve been spending the last months thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
and we walk down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about
the movies that your family watches
every single christmas
and i won’t talk about that
for the first time what’s past is past
‘cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it’s strange that you think i’m funny ‘cause he never did
i’ve been spending the last months thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
then on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
then on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
the story starts when it was hot and it was summer
and i had it all i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along got him alone and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say sabotage
i never saw it coming wouldn't have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge ha
she lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like i'm a trend and she's so over it
i think her ever present frown is a little troubling
and she thinks i'm psycho cause i like to rhyme her name with things but
sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
oh they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge ha ha
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
you might have him but haven't you heard
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
you might have him but i always get the last word whoa
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge
and do you still feel like you know what you're doing
cause i don't think you do oh
do you still feel like you know what you're doing
i don't think you do i don't think you do
let's hear the applause
c'mon show me how much better you are
see you deserve some applause
cause you're so much better
she took him faster than you can say sabotage
nice to meet you where you been

new money suit and tie

so it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
if the high was worth the pain
they'll tell you i'm insane
cause you know i love the players and you love the game
cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
or with a nasty scar

cherry lips crystal skies
i could show you incredible things

my castle crumbled overnight
i brought a knife to a gunfight
they took the crown but it's alright
all the liars are calling me one
nobody's heard from me for months
i'm doing better than i ever was
my baby's fit like a daydream
walking with his head down
i'm the one he's walking to
so call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
my baby's fly like a jet stream
high above the whole scene
loves me like i'm brand new
so call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
all my flowers grew back as thorns
windows boarded up after the storm
he built a fire just to keep me warm
all the drama queens taking swings
all the jokers dressing up as kings
they fade to nothing when i look at him
and i know i make the same mistakes every time
bridges burn i never learn
at least i did one thing right
i did one thing right
i'm laughing with my lover
trust him like a brother
yeah you know i did one thing right
starry eyes sparking up my darkest night
my baby's fit like a daydream
walking with his head down

so call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
my baby's fly like a jet stream
high above the whole scene
loves me like i'm brand new
so call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
i want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck
not because he owns me
but 'cause he really knows me
i recall late november holding my breath
slowly i said "you don't need to save me
but would you run away with me"
my baby's fit like a daydream
walking with his head down
i'm the one he's walking to
so call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
my baby's fly like a jet stream
high above the whole scene
loves me like i'm brand new
so call it what you want yeah call it what you want to

my winter nights are taken up by static
stress and holiday shopping traffic
but i close my eyes and i'm somewhere else
just like magic
in my heart is a christmas tree farm
to dance under sparkling lights
bundled up in their mittens and coats
and i just wanna be there tonight
sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
mistakes are forgiven
and everythin' is icy and blue
and you would be there too
under the mistletoe
watchin' the fire glow
and tellin' me "i love you"
just bein' in your arms
takes me back to that little farm
where every wish comes true
in my heart is a christmas tree farm
we run inside out from the cold
in the town kids are dreamin' of sleighs
they wake to see a blanket of snow
sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
mistakes are forgiven
and everythin' is icy and blue
and you would be there too
under the mistletoe
watchin' the fire glow
and tellin' me "i love you"
just bein' in your arms
takes me back to that little farm
where every wish comes true
baby yeah
and when i'm feelin' alone
you remind me of home
and when the world isn't fair
i pretend that we're there
baby baby merry christmas to you
under the mistletoe to you
watching the fire glow
and tellin' me "i love you"
oh baby baby merry christmas
oh baby baby merry christmas darling
oh baby baby merry christmas
i love you
oh baby baby merry christmas
oh baby baby merry christmas i just want you to know
oh baby baby merry christmas
wish come true
i love you
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
it was months and months of back and forth
you're still all over me like a winestained dress i can't wear anymore
hung my head as i lost the war and sky turned to black like a perfect storm
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean
there was nothing left to do
when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof
i let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
the water filled my lungs i screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean
i think i am finally clean
said i think i am finally clean
months sober i must admit
just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
months older i won't give in
now that i'm clean i'm never gonna risk it
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean
finally clean
think i'm finally clean
think i'm finally clean
you said it in a simple way
the second day
how strange that i don't know you at all
we stumble through the long goodbye
one last kiss then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall
i told myself don't get attached
but in my mind i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you
this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess you're in new york today
i don't wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
the delicate beginning rush
the feeling you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what i know now
i never would have played so nonchalant
taxi cabs and busy streets
they never bring you back to me
i can't help but wish you took me with you
this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess you're in london today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
aaaahhh aaaahhh
this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is falling for you when you are worlds away
in new york be here but you're in
london and i break down cause it's not fair
that you're not around
this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess you're in new york today
i don't wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
ahh ohh i don't want to miss you like this
ahh ohh
come back be here come back be here
for the whole song
we were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"i rent a place on cornelia street"
i say casually in the car
we were a fresh page on the desk
filling in the blanks as we go
as if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
leading us home
and i hope i never lose you hope it never ends
i'd never walk cornelia street again
that's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
i'd never walk cornelia street again
and baby i get mystified by how this city screams your name
and baby i'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again
windows swung right open autumn air
jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
we bless the rains on cornelia street
memorize the creaks in the floor
back when we were card sharks playing games
i thought you were leading me on
i packed my bags left cornelia street
before you even knew i was gone
but then you called showed your hand
i turned around before i hit the tunnel
sat on the roof you and i
and i hope i never lose you hope it never ends
i'd never walk cornelia street again
that's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
i'd never walk cornelia street again
and baby i get mystified by how this city screams your name
and baby i'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again
you hold my hand on the street
walk me back to that apartment
years ago we were just inside
barefoot in the kitchen
sacred new beginnings
that became my religion listen
i hope i never lose you
i'd never walk cornelia street again
ohoh never again
and baby i get mystified by how this city screams your name
and baby i'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i don't wanna lose you hope it never ends
i don't wanna lose you yeah
"i rent a place on cornelia street"
i said casually in the car

i'd never gone with the wind
just let it flow
let it take me where it wants to go
till you open the door there's so much more
i've never seen it before
i was trying to fly but i couldn't find wings
but you came along and you changed everything
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier crazier
feels like i'm falling and i
i'm lost in your eyes
you make me crazier crazier crazier
i watched from a distance as you
made life your own
every sky was your own kind of blue
and i wanted to know how that would feel
and you made it so real
you showed me something that i couldn't see
you opened my eyes and you made me believe
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier crazier
feels like i'm falling and i
i'm lost in your eyes
you make me crazier crazier crazier
baby you showed me what living is for
i don't want to hide anymore
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier crazier
feels like i'm falling and i
i'm lost in your eyes
you make me crazier crazier crazier
crazier crazier
my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in
everyone looked worse in the light
there are so many lines that i've crossed unforgiven
i'll tell you the truth but never goodbye
i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
i've been sleeping so long in a dark night
and now i see daylight i only see daylight
the luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
and so i became the butt of the joke
i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked
clearing the air i breathed in the smoke
maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
maybe i've stormed out of every single room in this town
threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
it's brighter now now
i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
i've been sleeping so long in a dark night
and now i see daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
and i can still see it all in my mind
all of you all of me intertwined
i once believed love would be black and white but it's golden golden
and i can still see it all in my head
back and forth from new york sneaking in your bed
i once believed love would be burning red but it's golden
like daylight like daylight
like daylight daylight
i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
and i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
i've been sleeping so long in a dark night
and now i see daylight i see daylight i only see daylight ahah ahah
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight ah ahah ahahh
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight ah ahah ahahh
like daylight it's golden like daylight
you gotta step into the daylight and let it go
just let it go let it go
i wanna be defined by the things that i love
not the things i hate
not the things that i'm afraid of i'm afraid of
not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
i i just think that
you are what you love
long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again
and my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules everyday
wondering which version of you i might get on the phone
well i stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
dear john i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i should've known
well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
and i'll look back and regret how i ignored when they said
run as fast as you can
dear john i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
dear john i see it all now it was wrong
don't you think too young to be played by
your dark twisted games when i loved you so
i should've known
you are an expert at sorry
and keeping lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that you've run dry
have tired lifeless eyes
cause you burned them out
but i took your matches before fire could catch me
so don't look now
i'm shining like fireworks
over your sad empty town
dear john i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress wrote you a song
you should've known
you should've known
don't you think i was too young
you should've known

my my my my

my my my my
saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk but it's not enough
'cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts
i dress to kill my time i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright they say "i don't know"
and what once was ours is no one's now
i see you everywhere the only thing we share is this small town
you said it was a great love one for the ages
but if the story's over why am i still writing pages
'cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk but it's not enough
'cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts
my heart my hips my body my love
tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
gave up on me like i was a bad drug
now i'm searching for signs in a haunted club
our songs our films united we stand
our country guess it was a lawless land
quiet my fears at the touch of your hand
paper cut stings from our paperthin plans
my time my wine my spirit my trust
tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
gave you too much but it wasn't enough
but i'll be alright it's just a thousand cuts
i get drunk but it's not enough
'cause you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not no it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts you didn't touch
tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
my body my love my trust it's death by a thousand cuts
but it wasn't enough it wasn't enough no no
i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
they say "i don't know"
dive bar on the east side where you at
phone lights up my nightstand in the black
come here you can meet me in the back
dark jeans and your nikes look at you
oh damn never seen that color blue
just think of the fun things we could do
'cause i like you this ain't for the best
my reputation's never been worse so
you must like me for me
yeah i want you we can't make
any promises now can we babe
but you can make me a drink

echoes of your footsteps on the stairs

there i was again tonight
forcing laughter faking smiles
same old tired lonely place
walls of insincerity
shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you
your eyes whispered 'have we met'
crossed the room your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was enchanting to meet you
all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
the lingering question kept me up
am who do you love
i wonder till i'm wide awake
i know i'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
i'd open up and you would say 'hey'
and it was enchanting to meet you
all i know is that i was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
this is me praying now
this was the very first page
not where the storyline ends
my thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back as i was leaving too soon
i was enchanted to meet you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
this night is sparkling
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
all i knew this morning when i woke
is i know something now know something now
i didn't before
and all i've seen since hours ago
is green eyes and freckles and your smile in
the back of my mind making me feel like
i just want to know you better know you better know you better now
i just want to know you better know you better know you better now
i just want to know you better know you better know you better now
i just want to know you know you know you
cause all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming home
all i know is a simple name everything has changed
all i know is you held the door
you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all i know since yesterday is everything has changed
and all my walls stood tall painted blue
but i'll take them down take them down
and open up the door for you
and all i feel in my stomach is butterflies
the beautiful kind making up for lost time
taking flight making me feel like
i just want to know you better know you better know you better now
i just want to know you better know you better know you better now
i just want to know you better know you better know you better now

and let me know that it's not all in my mind
i just want to know you better know you better know you better now
i just want to know you know you know you
cause all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming home

so dust off your highest hopes
all i know is pouring rain
and everything has changed
all i know is a new found grace
all my days i'll know your face
all i know since yesterday is everything has changed

it was the best of times the worst of crimes
i struck a match and blew your mind
but i didn't mean it
and you didn't see it
the ties were black the lies were white
in shades of gray in candlelight
i wanted to leave him
i needed a reason
x marks the spot where we fell apart
he poisoned the well i was lyin' to myself
i knew it from the first old fashioned we were cursed
we never had a shotgun shot in the dark
you were drivin' the getaway car
we were flyin' but we never get far
think about the place where you first met me
ridin' in a getaway car
there were sirens in the beat of your heart
think about the place where you first met me
in a getaway car ohohoh
no they never get far ohohahh
no nothing good starts in a getaway car
it was the great escape the prison break
the light of freedom on my face
but you weren't thinkin'
and i was just drinkin'
well he was runnin' after us i was screamin' "go go go"
but with three of us honey it's a sideshow
and now we're both sorry we're both sorry
x marks the spot where we fell apart
he poisoned the well every man for himself
i knew it from the first old fashioned we were cursed
it hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart
you were drivin' the getaway car
we were flyin' but we never get far
think about the place where you first met me
ridin' in a getaway car
there were sirens in the beat of your heart
think about the place where you first met me
in a getaway car ohohoh
no they never get far ohohahh
no nothing good starts in a getaway car
we were jetset bonnie and clyde ohoh
until i switched to the other side
it's no surprise i turned you in ohoh
'cause us traitors never win
i'm in a getaway car
i left you in a motel bar
put the money in a bag and i stole the keys
that was the last time you ever saw me
drivin' the getaway car
we were flyin' but we never get far don't pretend
think about the place where you first met me
ridin' in a getaway car
there were sirens in the beat of your heart should've known
think about the place where you first met me
in a getaway car ohohoh
no they never get far ohohahh
no nothing good starts in a getaway car
i was ridin' in a getaway car
i was cryin' in a getaway car
i was dyin' in a getaway car
said goodbye in a getaway car
ridin' in a getaway car
i was cryin' in a getaway car
i was dyin' in a getaway car
said goodbye in a getaway car
i bet this time of night you're still up
i bet you're tired from a long hard week
i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
looking out at the city
and i bet sometimes you wonder about me
and i just want to tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i don't
i almost dooooo
i bet you think i either moved on or hate you
'cause each time you reach out there's no reply
i bet it never ever occurred to you
that i can't say hello to you
and risk another goodbye
and i just want to tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i don't
i almost do
i almost doooo
it's probably better off this way
that in my dreams you're touching my face
and asking me if i want to try again with you
and i almost do
and i just want to tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i don't
i almost do
i almost doooo
i bet this time of night you're still up
i bet you're tired from a long hard week
i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
looking out at the city
and i hope sometimes you wonder about me
once upon a time a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights you got me alone
you found me you found me you found meeeee
i guess you didn't care and i guess liked that
and when i fell hard you took a step back
without me without me without meeeee
and he's long gone when he's next to me and i
'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me nowow
flew me to places i'd never been
'till you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me nowow
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
ahh oh oh trouble trouble trouble
ahh oh oh trouble trouble trouble
no apologies he'll never see you cry
pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
you're drowning you're drowning you're drowningeeeing
and i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
and now i see now i see now i seeeeee
he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me yeah
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me nowow
flew me to places i'd never been
'till you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me nowow
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
ahh oh oh trouble trouble trouble
ahh oh oh trouble trouble trouble
and the sadest fear comes creepin' in
that you never loved me or her
or anyone or anything yeah yeah
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me nowow
flew me to places i'd never been never been
'till you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in you were right there

ahh oh oh trouble trouble trouble
ahh oh oh trouble trouble trouble
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble trouble trouble
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at
the words that you whispered for just us to know
you told me you loved me so why did you go
away
away
i do recall now the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement i ran off the plane
that july the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt i can still feel your arms
but now i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be something you miss
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name forever the name on my lips
i do remember the swing in your step
the life of the party you're showing off again
and i roll my eyes and then you pull me in
i'm not much for dancin' but for you i did
because i love your handshake meetin' my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you kissed me when i was in the middle of sayin' something
there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions
and i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be something you miss
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name forever the name on my lips
ooooooh
so i'll watch your life in pictures
like i used to watch you sleep
and i'll feel you forget me
like i used to feel you breathe
and i'll keep up with our old friends
just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are
and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in the weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind
so i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be something you miss
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name forever the name on my lips
just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips
just like our last
we could leave the christmas lights up 'til january
this is our place we make the rules
and there's a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear
have i known you seconds or years
can i go where you go
can we always be this close forever and ever
and ah take me out and take me home
you're my my my my lover
we could let our friends crash in the living room
this is our place we make the call
and i'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
i've loved you three summers now honey but i want 'em all
can i go where you go
can we always be this close forever and ever
and ah take me out and take me home forever and ever
you're my my my my lover
ladies and gentlemen will you please stand
with every guitar string scar on my hand
i take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
all's well that ends well to end up with you
swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
and at every table i'll save you a seat lover
can i go where you go
can we always be this close forever and ever
and ah take me out and take me home forever and ever
you're my my my my
oh you're my my my my
darling you're my my my my lover
you with your words like knives and swords
and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feelin' like a nothin'
you with your voice like nails on a chalk board
callin' me out when i'm wounded
you pickin' on the weaker man
well you can take me down with just one single blow
but you don't know what you don't know
someday i'll be livin' in a big ol' city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
you with your switching sides and
your wild fire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
i walk with my head down
tryin' to block you out
'cause i never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again
i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now 'cause
you can't lead me down that road
and you don't know what you don't know
someday i'll be livin' in a big ol' city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
and i can see you years from now in a bar
talkin' over a football game
with that same big loud opinion
but nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the
same old bitter things
drunk and grumblin' all about how i can't sing
but all you are is mean
all you are is meanand a liarand pathetic
and alone in life and mean and mean and mean and mean
but someday i'll be livin' in a big ol' city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean yeahah

and all you're ever gonna be is mean

and all you're ever gonna be is mean why ya gotta be so mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me why ya gotta be so mean
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
oh ohoh ohoh
oh ohoh ohoh
you were in college working parttime waiting tables
left a small town never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of falling
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
i say can you believe it
as we're lying on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes yes i can see it now
do you remember we were sitting there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
flash forward and we're taking on the world together
and there's a drawer of my things at your place
you learned my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded
you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take yes yes
this is what i thought about
do you remember we were sitting there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
oh ohoh ohoh
and i remember that fight am
'cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
brace myself for the goodbye
cause that's all i've ever known
and you took me by surprise
you said i'll never leave you alone
you said "i remember how we felt sittin' by the water
and every time i look at you it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine
hold on make it last

lovin' him is like drivin' a new maserati
down a dead end street
faster than the wind passionate as sin
ended so suddenly
loving him is like tryin' to change your mind
once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn so bright
just before they lose it all
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
you never met
but loving him was red
re ee ed re ee ed re ee ed
lovin' him was red
re ee ed re ee ed re ee ed
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowin' all the words
to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like tryin' to solve a
crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
you never met
but loving him was red
re ee ed re ee ed oh red re ee ed
burnin' red re ee ed re ee ed
re ee ed
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echos
tellin' myself it's time now gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
and burning red
burning was reeeeed
oh losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody
you never met
cause loving him was red
yeah yeah red
oh burning reeeeeeeed
and that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
comes back to me burnin' red
yeah yeah
his love was like drivin' a new maserati
down a dead end street
long handwritten note deep in your pocket
words how little they mean when you're a little too late
i stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
good girls hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
in dreams i meet you in warm conversation
we both wake in lonely beds different cities
and time is taking it's sweet time erasing you
and you've got your demons and darling they all look like me
cause we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
distance timing breakdown fighting
silence the train runs off its tracks
kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
hang up give up and for the life of us we can't get back
a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful
what we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair

what a sad beautiful tragic love affair

the way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and i'm a house of cards
you're the kind of reckless that should send me running
but i kinda know that i won't get far
and you stood there in front of me just
close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldn't see what i was thinking of
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby
as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
my mind forgets to remind me
you're a bad idea
you touch me once and it's really something
you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be
i'm on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you i know it's no good
and i could wait patiently but
i really wish you would
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby
as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
i run my fingers through your hair
and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keeping your eyes on me
it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
and lead me up the staircase
won't you whisper soft and slow
i'm captivated by you baby like a fireworks show
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby
as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
and the sparks fly baby smile and the sparks fly
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in
on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family
all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
thiis iis surely not
what you thought it would be
ii lose myself in a daydream
don't say "yes" run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
fond gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play a song
that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvited
by your lovely bridetobe
shee floats down the aisle
like a pageant queen
but ii knoow
you wish it was me
don't say "yes" run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said "speak now"
don't say "yes" run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
your time is running out
and they said "speak now"
ohooho laaaahhoh
oooh say a single vow ooohooh
i hear the preacher say speak now
or forever hold your peace
there's a silence there's my last chance
i stand up with shaky hands
all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but i'm only lookin' at you
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in
on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
so don't say "yes" run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
they said "speak now"
and you say "let's run away now"
i'll meet you when i'm out
of my tux at the back door
baby i didn't say my vows
so glad you were around
when they said "speak noow"
i'm walking fast through the traffic lights
and all we know is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
or fades in time
and i never never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same
you come around and the armor falls
now all we know is don't let go
we are alone just you and me
just twin fire signs four blue eyes
so you were never a saint
but this love is brave and wild
and i never never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
these are the hands of fate
you're my achilles heel
this is the golden age of something
good and right and real
and i never never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same
i never never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
midnight you come and pick me up no headlights
long drive could end in burnin' flames or paradise
fade in to view oh it's been a while since i have even
heard from you heard from you
and i should just tell you to leave cause i
know exactly where it leads but i
watch us go round and round each time
you got that james dean day dream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down we come back every time
cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
you got the long hair slicked back white tshirt
and i got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
and when we go crashing down we come back every time
cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
so it goes he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
takes me home lights are off he's taking off his coat
i say "i heard oh that you've been out and about
with some other girl" some other girl
you say what you heard is true but i
can't stop thinking about you and i
i say i've been there too a few times
cause you got that james dean day dream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down we come back every time
cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
you got the long hair slicked back white tshirt
and i got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
and when we go crashing down we come back every time
cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
take me home
just take me home yeah
just take me home ohohohoh
cause you got that james dean day dream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down we come back every time
cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
found myself at your door
just like all those times before
i'm not sure how i got there
all roads they lead me here
i imagine you are home
in your room all alone
and you open your eyes into mine
and everything feels better
right before your eyes
i'm breaking and fast
no reasons why
just you and me
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name on the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye
you find yourself at my door
just like all those times before
you wear your best apology
but i was there to watch you leave
and all the times i let you in
just for you to go again
disappear when you come back
everything is better
when right before your eyes
i'm aching run fast
nowhere to hide
just you and me
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name on the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye
this is the last time you tell me i've got it wrong
this is the last time i say it's been you all along
this is the last time i let you in my door
this is the last time i won't hurt you anymore
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name on the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name on the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye
this is the last time i'm asking you last
time i'm asking you last
time i'm asking you this
this is the last time i'm asking you last
time i'm asking you last
time i'm asking you this
this is the last time i'm asking you last
time i'm asking you last
time i'm asking you this
this is the last time i'm asking you last
time i'm asking you last
time i'm asking you this
put your lips close to mine
as long as they don't touch
out of focus eye to eye
till the gravity is too much
and i'll do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and i'd be smart to walk away but you're quick sand
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i i i like it
i can't decide if it's a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
and all we are is skin and bone
trained to get along
forever going with the flow
but you're friction
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i i i like it
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you will get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the driving i will follow you follow you home
i follow you follow you home
this hope is treacherous
this day dream is dangerous
this hope is treacherous
i i i i i i i i i
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you will get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the driving
i will follow you follow you home
i follow you follow you home
i will follow you follow you home
i follow you follow you home
this slope is treacherous

standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
wildest dreams oh uh oh

his hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room
and his voice is a familiar sound nothing lasts forever
but this is getting good now

he's so bad but he does it so well
when we've had our very last kiss
my last request is

well now that you have got your gun
it's much harder now the police have come
and i'll shoot him if it's what you ask

and he's got his gun he's got his suit on
she says babe

we’re both throwing smoke into the night
it’s raining i suppose you need a ride
she said i’ve got nothing to do and neither do you
there’s a place down the road where we can waste the whole afternoon
i overhead that she was
she’s got a fake id and a nose ring
those kind of girls tend to know things
better than i do
and i’m dying to figure out what she’s hiding
she’s playing it cool but she’s lying better than i do
e|||||

it feels like a night to carry a tune
i’ve been carrying yours since you wrecked my room
and i’ve got nothing to do and neither do you
so we chase jack with love and waste away the whole afternoon
i overhead that she was
she’s got a fake id and a nose ring
those kind of girls tend to know things
better than i do
and i’m dying to figure out what she’s hiding
she’s playing it cool but she’s lying better than i do
thirty miles on the gulf stream i hear the south wind moan
the bridge is gettin' lower the shrimp boats comin' home
the old man down in the quarter slowly turns his head
takes a sip from his whiskey bottle and this is what he said
i was born in the rain on the pontchartrain underneath the loosiana moon
i don't mind the strain of a hurricane they come around every june
the high black water a devil's daughter she's hard she's cold and she's mean
but nobody taught her it takes a lot of water to wash away new orleans
man came down from chicago he gonna set that levee right… he says
it needs to be at least three feet higher it won't make it through the night
but the old man down in the quarter he said don't you listen to that boy

i was born in the rain on the pontchartrain underneath the loosiana moon
i don't mind the strain of a hurricane they come around every june
the high black water a devil's daughter she's hard she's cold and she's mean
but nobody taught her it takes a lot of water to wash away new orleans
thirty miles on the gulf stream i hear the south wind moan
the bridge is gettin' lower the shrimp boats comin' home
the old man down in the quarter slowly turns his head
takes a drink from his whiskey bottle and this is what he said
high black water a devil's daughter she's hard she's cold and she's mean
but nobody taught her it takes a lot of water to wash away new orleans

if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
oh oh oh oh
lord make me a rainbow i'll shine down on my mother
she'll know i'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be
no ain't even grey but she buries her baby
the sharp knife of a short life
well i've had just enough time
if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses

send me away with the words of a love song
the sharp knife of a short life
well i've had just enough time
and i'll be wearing white when i come into your kingdom
i'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
i've never known the loving of a man but it sure felt nice when he was
holding my hand
there's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
who would have thought forever could be severed by
the sharp knife of a short life
well i've had just enough time
so put on your best boys
and i'll wear my pearls
what i never did is done
a penny for my thoughts
oh no i'll sell them for a dollar
they're worth so much more after i'm a goner
and maybe then you'll hear the words i've been singing
funny when you're dead how people start listening
if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
oh oh the ballad of a dove
go in peace and love
gather up your tears
keep em in your pocket
save em for a time when you're really gonna need them
oh oh the sharp knife of a short life
well i've had just enough time
so put on your best boys
and i'll wear my pearls

i have a secret i want to tell you
each time that i close my eyes i can feel you
i ran away with my imagination
and i am blinded by your light that's filling up the room
oh
i have a secret i need to tell you
exquisite visions fill up my mind
do you remember me taking pictures of you
as the light came through
you were running away and i asked you for a place to stay
do you remember me taking pictures of you
taking pictures of you
i have a secret i need to tell you
i have been true and i needed no clue
we live in such extraordinary times
exquisite visions fill up my mind
do you remember me taking pictures of you
as the light came through
you were running away and i asked you for a place to stay
do you remember me taking pictures of you
such a wonderful thing to do
there once was a ship that put to sea
and the name of the ship was the billy o' tea
the winds blew hard her bow dipped down
blow me bully boys blow huh
soon may the wellerman come
to bring us sugar and tea and rum
one day when the tonguin’ is done
we’ll take our leave and go
she had not been two weeks from shore
when down on her a right whale bore
the captain called all hands and swore
he'd take that whale in tow huh
soon may the wellerman come
to bring us sugar and tea and rum
one day when the tonguin’ is done
we’ll take our leave and go
before the boat had hit the water
the whale's tail came up and caught her
all hands to the side harpooned and fought her
when she dived down below huh
soon may the wellerman come
to bring us sugar and tea and rum
one day when the tonguin’ is done
we’ll take our leave and go
no line was cut no whale was freed
the captain's mind was not of greed
but he belonged to the whaleman's creed
she took the ship in tow huh
soon may the wellerman come
to bring us sugar and tea and rum
one day when the tonguin’ is done
we’ll take our leave and go
for forty days or even more
the line went slack then tight once more
all boats were lost there were only four
but still that whale did go
soon may the wellerman come
to bring us sugar and tea and rum
one day when the tonguin’ is done
we’ll take our leave and go
as far as i've heard the fight's still on
the line's not cut and the whale's not gone
the wellerman makes his regular call
to encourage the captain crew and all
soon may the wellerman come
to bring us sugar and tea and rum
one day when the tonguin’ is done
we’ll take our leave and go
soon may the wellerman come
to bring us sugar and tea and rum
one day when the tonguin’ is done
we’ll take our leave and go

hello my old heart
how have you been
are you still there inside my chest
i've been so worried
you've been so still
barely beating at all
oh don't leave me here alone
don't tell me that we've grown
for having loved a little while
oh i don't want to be alone
i want to find a home
and i want to share it with you

and every day i add another stone
to the walls i built around you
to keep you safe

for having loved a little while
oh i don't want to be alone
i want to find a home
and i want to share it with you
hello my old heart
how have you been
how is it being locked away
well don't you worry
in there you're safe
and it's true you'll never beat
but you'll never break
nothing lasts forever
some things aren't meant to be
but you'll never find the answer
until you set your old heart free
until you set your old heart free
there will come a soldier
who carries a mighty sword
he will tear your city down
oh lei oh lai oh lord
o lei o lai
o lei o lord
he will tear your city down
oh lei oh lai oh lord
there will come a poet
whose weapon is his word
he will slay you with his tongue
oh lei oh lai oh lord
oh lei oh lai
oh lei oh lord
he will slay you with his tongue
oh lei oh lai oh lord
there will come a ruler
whose brow is laid in thorn
smeared with oil like david's boy

smeared with oil like david's boy

sure it’s a calming notion perpetual in motion
but i don’t need the comfort of any lies
for i have seen the ending and there is no ascending rise
oh back when i was younger was told by other youngsters
that my end will be torture beneath the earth
‘cuz i don’t see what they see when death is staring at me
i see a window a limit to live it or not at all
if you could pull the lever to carry on forever
would your life even matter anymore
sure it’s a calming notion perpetual in motion
but it’s not what you signed up for
i’m sure there won’t always be sunshine
but there’s this momentary beam of light
you don’t have to wait those salty decades
to get through the gate it’s all in front of your face
i’m sure there won’t always be sunshine
i’m sure there won’t always be sunshine
but there’s this momentary beam of light
i could cross the ocean in a fit of devotion
for every shining second this fragile body beckons
you think you’re owed it better believing ancient letters
sure it’s a calming notion but it’s a lie
she's all layed up in bed with a broken heart
while i'm drinking jack all alone in my local bar and we don't know how

on the other side of a street i knew stood a girl that looked like you
i guess that's deja vu but i thought this can't be true cause
you moved to west la or new york or santa fe or
wherever to get away from me
oh but that one night was more than just right
i didn't leave you cause i was all through
oh i was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
because i really fell for you
oh i swear to you i'll be there for you this is not a drive byiiii
just a shy guy looking for a twoply hefty bag to hold my iiii love
when you move me everything is groovy they don't like it sue me
umm the way you do me
oh i swear to you i'll be there for you this is not a drive byiiii
on the other side of a downward spiral my love for you went viral
and i loved you every mile you drove away
but now here you are again so let's skip the "how you been" and
get down to the "more than friends" at last
oh but that one night is still the highlight
i didn't leave you until i came to
and i was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
because i really fell for you
oh i swear to you i'll be there for you this is not a drive byiiii
just a shy guy looking for a twoply hefty bag to hold my iiii love
when you move me everything is groovy they don't like it sue me
umm the way you do me
oh i swear to you i'll be there for you this is not a drive byiiii
please believe that when i leave
there's nothing up my sleeve
but love for you and a little time to get my head together too
on the other side of a street i knew stood a girl that looked like you
i guess that's deja vu but i thought this can't be true cause
oh i swear to you i'll be there for you this is not a drive byiiii
just a shy guy looking for a twoply hefty bag to hold my iiii love
when you move me everything is groovy they don't like it sue me

all my friends are heathens take it slow

you don't know the half of the abused
welcome to the room of people
who have rooms of people that they loved one day docked away
just because we check the guns at the door
doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
you'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
you'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
you'll think "how'd i get here sitting next to you"
and after all i've said please don't forget
all my friends are heathens take it slow
wait for them to ask you who you know
please don't make any sudden moves
you don't know the half of the abused
we don't deal with outsiders very well
they say newcomers have a certain smell
you have trust issues not to mention
they say they can smell your intentions
you'll never know the freakshow sitting next to you
you have some weird people sitting next to you
you'll think "how'd i get here sitting next to you"
but after all i've said please don't forget watch it
all my friends are heathens take it slow
wait for them to ask you who you know

you don't know the half of the abused
all my friends are heathens take it slow watch it
wait for them to ask you who you know watch it
all my friends are heathens take it slow watch it
wait for them to ask you who you know
why'd you come you knew you should have stayed
i tried to warn you just to stay away
and now they're outside ready to bust
it looks like you might be one of us
she asked me "son when i grow old
will you buy me a house of gold
and when your father turns to stone
will you take care of me"
she asked me "son when i grow old
will you buy me a house of gold
and when your father turns to stone
will you take care of me"
i will make you
queen of everything you see
i'll put you on the map
i'll cure you of disease
let's say we up and left this town
and turned our future upsidedown
we'll make pretend that you and me
lived ever after happily
she asked me "son when i grow old
will you buy me a house of gold
and when your father turns to stone
will you take care of me"
i will make you
queen of everything you see
i'll put you on the map
i'll cure you of disease
and since we know that dreams are dead
and life turns plans up on their head
i will plan to be a bum
so i just might become someone
she asked me "son when i grow old
will you buy me a house of gold
and when your father turns to stone
will you take care of me"
i will make you
queen of everything you see
i'll put you on the map
i'll cure you of disease
i just wanna stay in the sun where i find
i know it’s hard sometimes
pieces of peace in the sun’s peace of mind
i know it’s hard sometimes
yeah i think about the end just way too much
but it’s fun to fantasize
on my enemies i wouldn’t wish who i was
but it’s fun to fantasize
oh oh whoa oh oh whoa
i’m falling so i’m taking my time on my ride
oh oh whoa
i’m falling so i’m taking my time on my ride
taking my time on my ride
"i'd die for you" that's easy to say
we have a list of people that we would take
a bullet for them a bullet for you
a bullet for everybody in this room
but i don't seem to see many bullets coming through
see many bullets coming through
metaphorically i'm the man
but literally i don't know what i'd do
"i'd live for you" and that's hard to do
even harder to say when you know it's not true
even harder to write when you know that tonight
there were people back home who tried talking to you
but then you ignored them still
all these questions they’re for real
like who would you live for who would you die for
and would you ever kill
oh oh whoa oh oh whoa
i’m falling so i’m taking my time on my ride
oh oh whoa
i’m falling so i’m taking my time on my ride
taking my time on my ride

i wish i found some better sounds no one's ever heard
i wish i had a better voice and sang some better words
i wish i found some chords in an order that is new
i wish i didn't have to rhyme every time i sang
i was told when i get older all my fears would shrink
but now i'm insecure and i care what people think
my name's blurryface and i care what you think
my name's blurryface and i care what you think
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our mommas sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our mommas sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
we're stressed out
sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when i was young
how come i'm never able to identify where it's coming from
i'd make a candle out of it if i ever found it
try to sell it never sell out of it i'd probably only ever sell one
it'd be to my brother cause we have the same nose
same clothes home grown the stones thrown from the creek we used to roam
but it would remind of when nothing really mattered
out of student loans and tree house homes we all would take the latter
my name's blurryface and i care what you think
my name's blurryface and i care what you think
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our mommas sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our mommas sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
we used to play pretend give each other different names
we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying
"wake up you need to make money"
we used to play pretend give each other different names
we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying
"wake up you need to make money"
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our mommas sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our mommas sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
we used to play pretend used to play pretend bunny
we used to play pretend wake up you need the money
used to play pretend used to play pretend bunny
we used to play pretend wake up you need the money
used to play pretend give each other different names
we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying
"wake up you need to make money" yeah

when the leader of the bad guys sang
something soft and soaked in pain
i heard the echo from his secret hideaway
he must've forgot to close his door
as he cranked out those dismal chords
and his four walls declared him insane
i found my way
right time wrong place
as i plead my case
you're the judge oh no
set me free
you're the judge oh no
set me free
i know my soul's freezing
hell's hot for good reason
so please take me
na na na na oh oh
na na na na oh oh

three lights are lit
but the fourth one's out
i can tell cause it's a bit darker
than the last night's bout
i forgot about the drought
of light bulbs in this house
so i head out
down a route i think is heading south
but i'm not good with directions
and i hide behind my mouth
i'm a pro at imperfections
and i'm best friends with my doubt
and now that my mind's out
and now i hear it clear and loud
i'm thinking 'wow
i probably should've stayed inside my house'
i found my way
right time wrong place
as i plead my case
you're the judge oh no
set me free
you're the judge oh no
set me free
i know my soul's freezing
hell's hot for good reason

is a surrender or a revel
i don't know if this one
is about me or the devil

is about me or the devil
you're the judge oh no

well my buckle makes impressions on the inside of her thigh
there are little feathered indians where we tussled through the night
if i'd known she was religious then i wouldn't have came stoned
to the house of such an angel too fucked up to get back home
lookin' over west virginia smoking spirits on the roof
she asked ain't anybody told ya that them things are bad for you
i said many folks had warned me there's been several people try
but up till now there ain't been nothing that i couldn't leave behind
hold me close my dear
sing your whisperin' song
softly in my ear
and i will sing along
honey tell me how your love runs true
and how i can always count on you
to be there when the bullets fly
i'd run across the river just to hold you tonight
well my heart is sweatin' bullets from the circles it has raced
like a little feathered indian calling out the clouds for rain
i go runnin' through the thicket i go careless through the thorns
just to hold her for a minute though it'd leave me wanting more
hold me close my dear
sing your whisperin' song
softly in my ear
and i will sing along
honey tell me how your love runs true
and how i can always count on you
to be there when the bullets fly
i'd run across the river just to hold you tonight

i'm a stone's throw from the mill
and i'm a good walk to the river
when my workin' day is over
we'll go swim our cares away
put your toes down in the water
and a smile across your face
and tell me that you love me
lovely lady may
now i ain't the sharpest chisel
that your hands have ever held
but darlin' i could love you well
'til the roll is called on high
i've seen my share of trouble
and i've held my weight in shame
but i'm baptized in your name
lovely lady may

lord the wind can leave you shiverin'
as it waltzes o'er the leaves
it's been rushin' through my timber
'til your love brought on the spring
now the mountains all are blushin'
and they don't know what to say
'cept a good long line of praises
for my lovely lady may
now i ain't the toughest hickory
that your axe has ever felled
but i'm a hickory just as well
i'm a hickory all the same
i came crashin' through the forest
as you cut my roots away
and i fell a good long ways
for my lovely lady may

csus and
you remind me of a sunday
back home in old kentucky
with the church choirs just beltin' to the pines
and i love you like the mountains
love the way the mornin' opens
to a soft and bright greetin' from the sun
so if it'd make you stay
i wouldn't act so angry all the time
i wouldn't keep it all inside
and i'd let you know how much i loved you every day
so darlin' will you stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones
well i used to ride a mustang
and i'd run that thing on high hopes
'til they raised the price of dreams so high i couldn't pay
so i let that car just sit there
when i should've took you drivin'
windows down while the music played
so if it'd make you stay
i wouldn't act so angry all the time
i wouldn't keep it all inside
and i'd let you know how much i loved you every day
so darlin' will you stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones
so darlin' will you stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones
early in the morning when the sun does rise
layin’ in the bed with bloodshot eyes
late in the evening when the sun sinks low
that’s about the time my rooster crows
i got women up and down this creek
and they keep me going and my engine clean
run me ragged but i don’t fret
cause there ain’t been one slow me down none yet
get me drinkin’ that moonshine
get my higher than the grocery bill
take my troubles to the high wall
throw ‘em in the river and get your fill
we been sniffin’ that cocaine
ain’t nothin’ better when the wind cuts cold
lord it’s a mighty hard living
but a damn good feelin’ to run these roads
i got people try to tell me red
keep this livin’ and you’ll wind up dead
cast your troubles on the lord of lords
wind up layin’ on a coolin’ board
but i got buddies up at white house road
and they keep me struttin’ when my feet hang low
rot gut whiskey gonna ease my pain
and all this runnin’s gonna keep me sane
get me drinkin’ that moonshine
get my higher than the grocery bill
take my troubles to the high wall
throw ‘em in the river and get your fill
we been sniffin’ that cocaine
ain’t nothin’ better when the wind cuts cold
lord it’s a mighty hard living
but a damn good feelin’ to run these roads
it’s a damn good feelin’ to run these roads
when you lay me in the cold hard clay
won’t you sing them hymns while the banjo plays
tell them ladies that they ought not frown
cause there ain’t been nothing ever held me down
lawman women or a shallow grave
same old blues just a different day
get me drinkin’ that moonshine
get my higher than the grocery bill
take my troubles to the high wall
throw ‘em in the river and get your fill
we been sniffin’ that cocaine
ain’t nothin’ better when the wind cuts cold
lord it’s a mighty hard living
but a damn good feelin’ to run these roads
it’s a damn good feelin’ to run these roads
it’s a damn good feelin’ to run these roads
the winter doesn’t want you
it haunts you summer serenading’s a long way
from this frozen place your face
our teacher our preacher
it’s nature and like flowers growing in a bomb crater
from nothing a rose it grows
i been thinking ‘bout the west coast
not the one that everyone knows
i'm sick of living in the shadows
we’ve one more chance before the light goes
before the summer of love
summer of love
we’re freezing we’re leaving
believing that all we need’s ahead of us somewhere
in a summer to come so we run
i been thinking ‘bout the west coast
not the one that everyone knows
i'm sick of living in the shadows
we’ve one more chance before the light goes
before the summer of love
summer of love
oh and when all is lost
when all is lost we find out what remains
oh the same ocean’s crossed
the summer’s pleasure the summer's pain
i been thinking ‘bout the west coast
not the one that everyone knows
in the rubble of aleppo
flowers blooming in the shadows
before the summer of love
summer of love

i saw you standing there
sandy blonde hair the way it came tumbling down
just like a waterfall
and if you need a light
i'll be the match to your candle
my darling i'm ready to burst into flames for you
i was just coasting till we met
you remind me just how good it can get
well i've been on fire dreaming of you
tell me you don't it feels like you do
looking like that you'll open some wounds
how does it start and when does it end
only been here for a moment but i know i want you
but is it too soon
to know that i'm with you
there's nothing i can do
and sometime around one
we fell asleep to escape from the sun
and we woke up to the sound of a storm outside
we stood at your front door
you looked at me and said "baby this rain changes everything"
and my heart ran away from me
i was just coasting till we met
you remind me just how good it can get
well i've been on fire dreaming of you
tell me you don't it feels like you do
opening up can open some wounds
how does it start and when does it end

my teeth are yellow hello world

oh don't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me
i said you're holding back
she said shut up and dance with me
this woman is my destiny
she said oh oh oh
shut up and dance with me
we were victims of the night
the chemical physical kryptonite
helpless to the bass and faded light
oh we were bound to get together
bound to get together
she took my arm
i don't know how it happened
we took the floor and she said
oh don't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me
i said you're holding back
she said shut up and dance with me
this woman is my destiny
she said oh oh oh
shut up and dance with me
a backless dress and some beat up sneaks
my discothèque juliet teenage dream
i felt it in my chest as she looked at me
i knew we were bound to be together
bound to be together
she took my arm
i don't know how it happened
we took the floor and she said
oh don't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me
i said you're holding back
she said shut up and dance with me
this woman is my destiny
she said oh oh oh
shut up and dance with me
deep in her eyes
i think i see the future
i realize this is my last chance
she took my arm
i don't know how it happened
we took the floor and she said
oh don't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me
i said you're holding back
she said shut up and dance with me
this woman is my destiny
she said oh oh oh
shut up and dance
oh don't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me
i said you're holding back
she said shut up and dance with me

she said oh oh oh

andromeda's a big wide open galaxy
nothing in it for me except a heart that's lazy
running from my own life now
i'm really turning some time
looking up to the sky for something i may never find
stop calling
it's time to let me be
if you think you can save me
i'd dare you to try
lift the heart from the depths it's fallen to
we all want something new
but can't seem to follow through
something's better than nothing
or so that i thought
now i know it's just one dream
all these others gonna tear me apart
love is calling
it's time to let it through
find a love that will make you
i dare you try
crazy guy
i think this is deep
think it's meant to be
more than anything i can think of
i'm ready to try
treat me right
i'm still a good man's daughter
let me in if i break
and be quiet if i shatter
getting tired of looking
you know that i hate the game
don't wanna waste any more time
you know i been holding out
love is calling
it's time to give to you
something you can hold onto
i dare you try
i lost the passion that comes with living
since i started university
i took a geography course to learn the datelines
and maybe use a sextant
but now i just press facsimiles
and you're exactly who you wanted to be
that's what you said
'cause you wanna watch tv and sleep all day and lay in bed but
you're forgetting that i've got to go to work and eat my food
and pay my rent and reproduce and feed those kids
and maybe use a sextant
i don't miss you
i miss the thought of what we were
this is the part where i shut up and let you infest my brain
wrap your arms around my cortex dig you in and let you drain
you'll never get rid of me oh i'm like a fucking disease
i'll make a home in your gut
'cause it's somewhere warm to sleep
what was your thought when you realised
you'll never feel naive love again
was it pain or was it sickness
were you proud of who you'd been
the shyness waiting for his phone calls
replaced by apathy 'n' dating apps
you held his hands it felt like flying
now he's just another man
you'd rather he was inside than beside you
but he's talking marriage and a future
he's picking a lock he doesn't go into
less knife in a wound he's a suture
i don't miss you
i miss the thought of what we were
this is the part where i shut up and let you infest my brain
but it's okay it's a strategy to ensure i remain
you'll never get rid of me well i'm like a fucking disease
i'll make a home in your gut
'cause it's somewhere warm to sleep
it's okay
it's okay
eat my rent and eat my food
and eat my dues and eat those kids
and maybe use a sextant
he never had cool stories
he doesn't make your heart beat
used to love his mystery
but now he's just exhausting
another day spent just laying in his room
the stench of incense
and some undelivered food
and she thought
"what if he thinks i'm the one
and i'll be forced to rot away
with him and his obsessions
with trivial things
like the amount of fucking love hearts i finish a text message with"
and when you hold his hands
it doesn't feel like flying
and when you take his breath away
he might as well be dying
and you're dying to breathe
you're trapped in his cage
and it's shrinking
and she thought
"what if he just never leaves
or if he doesn't get the message
and he doesn't hear my pleas"
so she just started screaming
"why can't he just bore me to death"
"why can't he just bore me to death"
"oh why can't he just bore me to death"
"why can't he just bore me to death"
"oh why can't he just bore me to death"
"why can't he just bore me to death"
"oh why can't he just bore me to death"

she'd trade colorado if he'd take her with him
closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
and wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
she's answered by the tail lights
shining through the window pane
he said i wanna see you again
but i'm stuck in colder weather
maybe tomorrow will be better
can i call you then
she said you're ramblin' man
you ain't ever gonna change
you gotta gypsy soul to blame
and you were born for leavin'
at a truck stop diner just outside of lincoln
the night as black as the coffee he was drinkin'
and in the waitress' eyes he sees the same 'ol light shinin'
he thinks of colorado
and the girl he left behind him
he said i wanna see you again
but i'm stuck in colder weather
maybe tomorrow will be better
can i call you then
she said you're ramblin' man
you ain't ever gonna change
you gotta gypsy soul to blame
and you were born for leavin'
born for leavin'
well it's a winding road
when you're in the lost and found
you're a lover i'm a runner
and we go 'round 'n 'round
and i love you but i leave you
i don't want you but i need you
you know it's you who calls me back here baby
oh i wanna see you again
but i'm stuck in colder weather
maybe tomorrow will be better
can i call you then
cuz i'm a ramblin' man
i ain't ever gonna change
i gotta gypsy soul to blame
and i was born for leavin'
born for leavin'
i can smell your perfume through these whispering pines
i'm with your ghost again
it's a shame about the weather
i know soon we'll be together
and i can't wait till then
i can't wait till then
gonna put the the world away for a minute
pretend i don't live in it
sunshine gonna wash my blues away
had sweet love but i lost it
she got too close so i fought it
now i'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
wishing i was knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
not a worry in the world as the tide's gonna reach my chair
sunrise there's a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise
wrote a note said be back in a minute
bought a boat and i sailed off in it
don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway
i'm on a permanent vacation
the ocean is my only medication
wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away
cause now im knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
not a worry in the world as the tide's gonna reach my chair
sunrise there's a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise
this champagne shore washing over me
it's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
one day you could be as lost as me
change you're geography
maybe you might be
knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
not a worry in the world as the tide's gonna reach my chair
sunrise there's a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise
come on in the water's nice
find yourself a little slice
grab a bag pack it light
you never know until you try
when you lose yourself
you find the key to paradise
