i’ll be gone
in a day or two
and i'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
how i hate to spend the evening on my own
blowing outside the window as i look around the room
and it makes me so depressed to see the phone
there's not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day
find the end of the rainbow with that fortune to win
it's so different from the world i'm living in
i open the window and i gaze into the night
but there's nothing there to see no one in sight
there's not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
there's not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day
repeat to fade
no more champagne and the fireworks are through
here we are me and you feeling lost and feeling blue
it's the end of the party and the morning seems so gray
so unlike yesterday now's the time for us to say
happy new year happy new year
may we all have a vision now and then
of a world where every neighbour is a friend
happy new year happy new year
may we all have our hopes our will to try
if we don't we might as well lay down and die
you and i
sometimes i see how the brave new world arrives
and i see how it thrives in the ashes of our lives
oh yes man is a fool and he thinks he'll be ok
dragging on ooo feet of clay ooo never knowing he's astray
keeps on goinganyway
happy new year happy new year
may we all have a vision now and then
of a world where every neighbour is a friend
happy new year happy new year
may we all have our hopes our will to try
if we don't we might as well lay down and die
youand i
seems to me now that the dreams we had before
are all dead nothing more than confetti on the floor
it's the end of a decade in another ten years time
who can say ooo what we'll find ooo
what lies waiting down the line
in the end ofeightynine
happy new year happy new year
may we all have a vision now and then
of a world where every neighbour is a friend
happy new year happy new year
may we all have our hopes our will to try
if we don't we might as well lay down and die
youand i
an eighties smash from kraziekhat
i wasn't jealous before we met
now every woman i see is a potential threat
and i'm possessive it isn't nice
you've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
but now it isn't true
now everything is new
and all i've learned has o verturned
i beg of you
don't go wasting your e mo tion
lay all your love on me
it was like shooting a sitting duck
a little small talk a smile and baby i was stuck
i still don't know what you've done with me
a grownup woman should never fall so easily
i feel a kind of fear
when i don't have you near
unsatisfied i skip my pride
i beg you dear
don't go wasting your e mo tion
lay all your love on me
don't go sharing your de vo tion
lay all your love on me
i've had a few little love affairs
they didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
i used to think i was sensible
it makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'cause everything is new
and everything is you
and all i've learned has o verturned
what can i do
don't go wasting your e mo tion
lay all your love on me
don't go sharing your de vo tion
lay all your love on me
don't go wasting your e mo tion
lay all your love on me
don't go sharing your de vo tion
lay all your love on me
schoolbag in hand
she leaves home in the early morning
waving goodbye
with an absentminded smile
i watch her go
with a surge of that wellknown sadness
and i have to sit down for a while
the feeling that i'm losing her forever
and without really entering her world
i'm glad whenever i can share her laughter that funny little girl
slipping through my fingers all the time
i try to capture every minute
the feeling in it
slipping through my fingers all the time
do i really see what's in her mind
each time i think i'm close to knowing
she keeps on growing
slipping through my fingers all the time
sleep in our eyes
her and me at the breakfast table
barely awake
i let precious time go by
then when she's gone
there's that odd melancholy feeling
and a sense of guilt i can't deny
what happened to the wonderful adventures
the places i had planned for us to go slipping through my fingers all the time
well some of that we did
but most we didn't
and why i just don't know
slipping through my fingers all the time
i try to capture every minute
the feeling in it
slipping through my fingers all the time
do i really see what's in her mind
each time i think i'm close to knowing
she keeps on growing
slipping through my fingers all the time
sometimes i wish that i could freeze the picture
and save it from the funny tricks of time
slipping through my fingers
slipping through my fingers all the time
schoolbag in hand
she leaves home in the early morning
waving goodbye with an absentminded smile
super trouper beams are gonna blind me
but i won't feel blue
like i always do
'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
i was sick and tired of everything

everything will be so different
when i'm on the stage tonight

feeling like a number one
super trouper beams are gonna blind me
but i won't feel blue

'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
so i'll be there when you arrive
the sight of you will prove to me i'm still alive
and when you take me in your arms
and hold me tight
i know it's gonna mean so much tonight
super trouper lights are gonna find me
shining like the sun
smiling having fun
feeling like a number one
super trouper beams are gonna blind me

jag är en lugn person med takt och ton måttfull och balanserad
jag är tyst och still och det ska mycket till innan jag blir exalterad
men jag har en last som håller mig fast i ett järngrepp varje vinter
när året är slut och snön ligger djup och slädarnas medar slinter
jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul
tusen stjärnor som tindrar glitter så långt jag ser
av juleljus som glimmar vill jag ha mer
en show glöms bort om den bara visar opp effekter som man knappast anar
så ge mig trettio grader kallt tomtar överallt och en skog av gröna granar
jag vill ha snötyngda hus tusentals ljus kulörta kulor i drivor
bjällerklang som ackompanjemang på alla julens skivor
jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul
tusen stjärnor som tindrar glitter så långt jag ser
av juleljus som glimmar vill jag ha mer
ge mig en svårknäckt nöt sötare gröt djupare dopp i grytan
glittrigare glim och grötigare rim och mer arne weise i rutan
jag vill ha rymligare säck segare knäck fetare fläsk från grisen
krimsigare krams längre långdans och raskare räv på isen
jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul
tusen stjärnor som tindrar glitter så långt jag ser
av juleljus som glimmar vill jag ha mer
jag vill ha mer mer ge mig mer mer
jag vill ha mer mer ge mig mer mer fade out
i'm lying alone with my head on the phone
thinking of you 'til it hurts
i know you hurt too but what else can we do
tormented and torn apart
i wish i could carry your smile in my heart
for times when my life seems so low
it would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
when today doesn't really know doesn't really know
i'm all out of love i'm so lost without you
i know you were right believing for so long
i'm all out of love what am i without you
i can't be too late to say that i was so wrong
i want you to come back and carry me home
away from these long lonely nights
i'm reaching for you are you feeling it too
does the feeling seem oh so right
and what would you say if i called on you now
and said that i can't hold on
there's no easy way it gets harder each day
please love me or i'll be gone i'll be gone
i'm all out of love i'm so lost without you
i know you were right believing for so long
i'm all out of love what am i without you
i can't be too late to say that i was so wrong
oooowhat are you thinking of
what are you thinking of
what are you thinking of

i'm all out of love i'm so lost without you
i know you were right believing for so long
i'm all out of love what am i without you

i know you were right believing for so long
i'm all out of love what am i without you

i know you were right believing for so long
i'm all out of love what am i without you
i can't be too late to say that i was so wrong
i'm all out of love i'm so lost without you
i know you were right
here i am playing with those
memories again
and just when i thought time has
set me free
those thoughts of you keep taunting me
holding you a feeling i never outgrew
though each and every part of me has tried
only you can fill that space inside
so there's no sense pretending
my heart it's not mending
just when i though i was over you
just when i though i could stand
on my own
oh baby those memories come
crashing through
and i just can't goon without you
on my own i've tried to make the best of it alone
i've done everything i can to ease
the pain
but only you can stop the rain
i just can't live without you
i miss everything about you
just when i though i was over you
just when i though i could stand
on my own
oh baby those memories come
crashing through
and i just can't goon without you
go on without
it's just no good without you
without you without you without you
oh baby those memories come
crashing through
and i just can't go on without you

comme elle est partie jim a les nerfs
jimmy boit du gin dans sa chrysler
la presqu'île le boulevard de la mer est con
comme elle est partie attention jimmy tourne en rond
hier soir encore son héroïne
le serrait si fort en disant "jim"
elle était son calmant son alcool profond
comme elle est partie attention jimmy tourne pas rond
jimmy t'es fort mais tu pleures sur le cuir de ta chrysler
làbas le soleil s'écroule dans la mer
jimmy les filles pour le coeur comme l'alcool et les revolvers
c'est sauter en l'air tomber par terre
boum
depuis deux ans sûr jim bossait fort
pour que sa starlette bronze en horsbord
avec elle il voulait un bébé sans rire
comme elle est partie attention jimmy veut mourir
jimmy t'es fort mais tu pleures sur le cuir de ta chrysler
làbas le soleil s'écroule dans la mer
jimmy les filles pour le coeur comme l'alcool et les revolvers

il sent son parfum sur la corniche
les lacets le gravier et dans l'air du soir
la chrysler s'envole dans les fougères et les nénuphars
jimmy s'éveille dans l'air idéal
le paradis clair d'une chambre d'hôpital
l'infirmière est un ange et ses yeux sont verts
comme elle lui sourit attention jimmy veut lui plaire
with blues fills bars
mississippi in the middle of a dry spell

a new religion that'll bring you to your knees
black velvet if you please

let's dance in style let's dance for a while
heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
hoping for the best but expecting the worst
are you gonna drop the bomb or not
let us stay young or let us live forever
we don't have the power but we never say never
sitting in the sandpit life is a short trip
the music's for the sad man
can you imagine when this race is won
turn our golden faces into the sun
praising our leaders we're getting in tune
the music's played by the mad man
forever young
i want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever and ever
forever young
i want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever young
some are like water some are like the heat
some are the melody and some are the beat
sooner or later they all will be gone
why don't they stay young
it's so hard to get old without a cause
i don't want to perish like a fading horse
youth's like diamonds in the sun
and diamonds are forever
so many adventures given up today
so many songs we forgot to play
so many dreams swinging out of the blue
oh let it come true
forever young
i want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever and ever
forever young
i want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever young
forever young
i want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever and ever
forever young
i want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever young

age to age you’re still the same by the power of the name
el shaddai el shaddai erkahmka na adonai
we will praise and lift you high el shaddai
through your love and through the ram you saved the son of abraham
through the power of your hand turned the sea into dry land
to the outcast on her knees you were the god who really sees
and by your might you set your children free
el shaddai el shaddai elelyon na adonai
age to age you’re still the same by the power of the name
el shaddai el shaddai erkahmka na adonai
we will praise and lift you high el shaddai
through the years you made it clear that the time of christ was near
though the people couldn’t see what messiah ought to be
though your word contained the plan they just would not understand
your most awesome work was done through the frailty of your son
el shaddai el shaddai elelyon na adonai
age to age you’re still the same by the power of the name
el shaddai el shaddai erkahmka na adonai

rockies are calling denver snow falling
somebody said it's four feet deep
but it doesn't matter give me the laughter
i'm gonna choose to keep
another tender tennessee christmas
the only christmas for me
where the love circles around us
like the gifts around our tree
well i know there's more snow up in colorado
than my roof will ever see
but a tender tennessee christmas
is the only christmas for me
every now and then i get a wandering urge to see
maybe california maybe tinseltown's for me
there's a parade there we'd have it made there
bring home a tan for new year's eve
sure sounds exciting awfully inviting
still i think i'm gonna keep
another tender tennessee christmas
the only christmas for me
where the love circles around us
like the gifts around our tree
well i know there's more snow up in colorado
than my roof will ever see
but a tender tennessee christmas
is the only christmas for me
well i know there's more snow up in colorado
than my roof will ever see
but a tender tennessee christmas
is the only christmas for me
but a tender tennessee christmas
is the only christmas for me
= or if preceded by
there i was
an empty piece of a shell
just mindin' my own world
without even knowin'
what love and life were all about
then you came
you brought me out of the shell
you gave the world to me
and before i knew
there i was so in love with you
you gave me a reason for my being
and i love what i'm feelin'
you gave me a meaning to my life
yes i've gone beyond existing
and it all began
when i met you
i love the touch of your hair
and when i look in your eyes
i just know i know i'm on to something good
and i'm sure
my love for you will endure
your love will light up my world
and take all my cares
away with the aching part of me
you gave me a reason for my being
and i love what i'm feelin'
you gave me a meaning to my life
yes i've gone beyond existing
and it all began
when i met you
you taught me how to love
you showed me how tomorrow and
today my life is diff'rent from the yesterday
and you you taught me to love
and darling i will always cherish you
today tomorrow and forever
and i'm sure
when evening comes around
i know we'll be making love
like never before
my love who could ask for more
you gave me a reason for my being
and i love what i'm feelin'
you gave me a meaning to my life
yes i've gone beyond existing
and it all began
when i met you
when i met you
you gave me a reason for my being
and i love what i'm feelin'
you gave me a meaning to my life
yes i've gone beyond existing
and it all began
when i met you
when i met you

meet me down by the jetty landing
where the the pontoons bump and sway
i see the others reading standing
as the manly ferry cuts its way to circular quay
hear the captain blow his whistle
so long she's been away
i miss our early morning wrestle
not a very happy way to start the day
she don't like that kind of behaviour
she don't like that kind of behaviour
so throw down your guns
don't be so reckless
throw down your guns
don't be so
feel like scott of the antarctic
base camp too far away
a russian sub beneath the arctic
burke and wills and camels
initials in the tree
she don't like that kind of behaviour
she don't like that kind of behaviour
so throw down your guns
don't be so reckless
throw down your guns
don't be so
we had the right love
at the wrong time
guess i always knew inside
i wouldn't have you for a long time
those dreams of yours
are shining on distant shores
and if they're calling you away
i have no right to make you stay
but somewhere down the road
our roads are gonna cross again
it doesn't really matter when
but somewhere down the road
i know that heart of yours
will come to see
that you belong with me
sometimes goodbyes
are not forever
it doesn't matter if you're gone
i still believe in us to – ge ther
i understand
more than you think i can
you have to go out on your own
so you can find your way back home
letting go is just another way to say
i'll always love you so
we had the right love
at the wrong time
maybe we've only just begun
maybe the best is yet to come
watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
on this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame
turning and returning to some secret place inside
watching in slow motion as you turn around and say
take my breath away
take my breath away
watching i keep waiting still anticipating love
never hesitating to become the fated ones
turning and returning to some secret place to hide
watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say my love
take my breath away
take my breath away
through the hourglass i saw you in time you slipped away
when the mirror crashed i called you and turned to hear you say
if only for today i am unafraid
take my breath away
take my breath away
watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
turning and returning to some secret place inside
watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say my love
take my breath away
take my breath away
it must have been cold there in my shadow
to never have sunlight on your face
you were content to let me shine that's your way
you always walked a step behind
so i was the one with all the glory
while you were the one with all the strain
a beautiful face without a name for so long
a beautiful smile to hide the pain
did you ever know that you're my hero
and everything i would like to be
i can fly higher than an eagle
for you are the wind beneath my wings
it might have appeared to go unnoticed
but i've got it all here in my heart
i want you to know i know the truth of course i know it
i would be nothing without you
did you ever know that you're my hero
and everything i would like to be
i can fly higher than an eagle
for you are the wind beneath my wings
did you ever know that you're my hero
and everything i would like to be
i can fly higher than an eagle
for you are the wind beneath my wings
i was twenty one years when i wrote this song
im twenty two now but i wont be for long
people ask me when will you grow up to be a man
but all the girls i loved at school
are already pushing prams
i loved you then as i love you still
though i put you on a pedestal
they put you on the pill
i dont feel bad about letting you go
i just feel sad about letting you know
i dont want to change the world
im not looking for a new england
im just looking for another girl
i don’t want to change the world
im not looking for a new england
im just looking for another girl
i loved the words you wrote to me
but that was bloody yesterday
i cant survive on what you send
every time you need a friend
i saw two shooting stars last night
i wished on them but they were only satellites
its wrong to wish on space hardware
i wish i wish i wish you’d care
i dont want to change the world
im not looking for a new england
im just looking for another girl
i dont want to change the world
im not looking for a new england
im just looking for another girl
looking for another girl
looking for another girl
looking for another girl

on the floors of tokyo
or down in london town to go go
with the record selection and the mirror's reflection
i'm a dancing with myself
when there's noone else in sight
in the crowded lonely night
well i wait so long for my love vibration
and i'm dancing with myself
ohoh dancing with myself
ohoh dancing with myself
when there's nothing to lose and there's nothing to prove
and i'm dancing with myself oh oh oh
if i looked all over the world
and at every type of girl
but your empty eyes seem to pass me by
leave me dancing with myself
so let's sink another drink
'cause it'll give me time to think
if i had the chance i'd ask the world to dance
and not be dancing with myself
ohoh dancing with myself
ohoh dancing with myself
when there's nothing to lose and there's nothing to prove
when i'm dancing with myself oh oh ohoh
oh oh ohoh oh

i'm all out of hope one more bad dream could bring a fall
when i'm far from home don't call me on the phone to tell me you're alone
it's easy to deceive it's easy to tease but hard to get release
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
got no human grace your eyes without a face
i spend so much time believing all the lies to keep the dream alive
now it makes me sad it makes me mad at truth for loving what was you
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
got no human grace your eyes without a face
e||
e||
now i close my eyes and i wonder why i don't despise
now all i can do is love what was once so alive and new
but it's gone from your eyes i'd better realize
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
got no human grace your eyes without a face
such a human waste your eyes without a face and now it's getting worse

and when she wakes up
and makes up her mind
she'll see i'm not so tough
just because

and then i'll win
and when she's walking
she's looking so fine
and when she's talking
she'll say that she's mine
she'll say i'm not so tough

friday night i crashed your party
sunday came and trashed me out again
i was only having fun
wasn't hurting anyone
and we all enjoyed the
weekend for a change
i've been stranded in the combat zone
even rode my motorcycle in the rain
and you told me not to drive
but i made it home alive
so you said that only proves that i'm insane
you may be right
i may be crazy
oh but it just may be a lunatic
you're looking for
turn out the light
don't try to save me
you may be wrong for all i know
but you may be right
remember how i found you there
i told you dirty jokes until you smiled
you were lonely for a man
i said "take me as i am"
'cause you might enjoy some madness for a while
now think of all the years you tried to
i might be as crazy as you say
if i'm crazy then it's true
that it's all because of you
and you wouldn't want me any other way
you may be right
i may be crazy
oh but it just may be a lunatic
you're looking for
it's too late to fight
it's too late to change me
you may be wrong for all i know
but you may be right
you may be right
i may be crazy
hey but it just may be a lunatic
you're looking for
turn out the light
don't try to save me
you may be wrong for all i know
but you may be right
you may be wrong but you may be right
you may be wrong but you may be right
you may be wrong but you may be right
you may be wrong but you may be right
you may be right
i may be crazy
turn out the light
don't try to save me
you may be right

standing on the water casting your bread
while the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
distant ships sailing into the mist
you were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was
freedom just around the corner for you
but with truth so far off what good will it do
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
so swiftly the sun sets in the sky
you rise up and say goodbye to no one
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
both of their futures so full of dread you don't show one
shedding off one more layer of skin
keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
you're a man of the mountain you can walk on the clouds
manipulator of crowds you're a dream twister
you're going to sodom and gomorrah
but what do you care ain't nobody there would want marry your sister
friend to the martyr a friend to the woman of shame
you look into the fiery furnace see the rich man without any name
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
well the book of leviticus and deuteronomy
the law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
in the smoke of the twilight on a milkwhite steed
michelangeo indeed could've carved out your features
resting in the fields far from the turbulent space
half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
well the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
preacherman seeks the same who'll get there first is uncertain
nightsticks and water cannons tear gas padlocks
molotow cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
falsehearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
only a matter of time 'til the night comes stepping in
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
it's a shadowy world skies are slippery gray
a woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
he'll put the priest in his pocket put the blade to the heat
take the motherless children off the street
and place them at the feet of a harlot
oh jokerman you know what he wants
oh jokerman you don't show any response
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman

it seems like yesterday
but it was long ago
jenny was lovely she was the queen of my nights
there in the darkness with the radio playing low
the mountains that we moved
caught like wildfire out of control
till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
and i remember what she said to me
how she swore that it never would end
i remember how she held me oh so tight
wish i didn't know now what i didn't know then
against the wind we were running against the wind
we were young and strong we were running against the wind
and the years rolled slowly past
and i found myself alone
surrounded by strangers i thought were my friends
i found myself further and further from my home
there were oh so many roads
i was living to run and running to live
never worrying about paying or even how much i owed
runnin' miles a minute for months at a time
breaking all of the rules that would bend
i begin to find myself just searching
searching for shelter again and again
against the wind a little something against the wind
i found myself seeking shelter against the wind
well those drifter's days are past me now
i've got so much more to think about
deadlines and commitments
what to leave in what to leave out
against the wind
i'm still running against the wind
i'm older now but still running against the wind
well i'm older now but still running against the wind
against the wind
against the wind
against the wind still running
against the wind i m still running against the wind
against the wind i m still running
against the wind i m still running against the wind
against the wind still running
against the wind running against the wind running against the wind
against the wind see the young man run
against the wind watch the young man run
against the wind watch the young man running
against the wind he ll be running against the wind
against the wind let the cowboys ride
against the wind ohhhhh
against the wind let the cowboys ride
against the wind they ll be riding against the wind
against the wind against the wind
against the wind riding against the wind
against the wind
who's gonna ride that chrome three wheeler
who's gonna make that first mistake
who wants to wear those gypsy leathers
all the way to fire lake
who wants to break the news about uncle joe
you remember uncle joe he was the one afraid to cut the cake
who wants to tell poor aunt sarah
joe's run off to fire lake
joe's run off to fire lake
who wants to brave those bronze beauties lying in the sun
with their long soft hair fallin' flyin' as they run
oh they smile so shy and they flirt so well
and they lay you down so fast till you look straight up and say
oh lord am i really here at last
wants to play those eights and aces
who wants a raise who needs a stake
who wants to take that long shot gamble
and head out to fire lake
and head out to fire lake with varying lyrics
stood there boldly sweatin' in the sun
felt like a million felt like number one
the height of summer i'd never felt that strong
like a rock
i was eighteen didn't have a care
workin' for peanuts not a dime to spare
but i was lean and solid everywhere
like a rock
my hands were steady my eyes were clear and bright
my walk had purpose my steps were quick and light
and i held firm to what i felt was right
like a rock
like a rock i was strong as i could be
like a rock nothin' ever got to me
like a rock i was something to see
like a rock
and i stood arrow straight unencumbered by the weight
of all these hustlers and their schemes
i stood proud i stood tall high above it all
i still believed in my dreams
twenty years now where'd they go
twenty years i don't know
i sit and i wonder sometimes
where they've gone
and sometimes late at night
oh when i'm bathed in the firelight
the moon comes callin' a ghostly white
and i recall i recall
like a rock standin' arrow straight
like a rock chargin' from the gate
like a rock carryin' the weight
like a rock
like a rock the sun upon my skin
like a rock hard against the wind
like a rock i see myself again
like a rock
moving into the next chord
until youve been beside a man
you dont know what he wants
you dont know if he cries at night
you dont know if he don’t
when nothin comes easy
old nightmares are real
until you ve been beside a man
you dont know how he feels
once inside a womans heart
a man must keep his head
heaven opens up the door
where angels fear to tread
some men go crazy
some men go slow
some men go just where they want
some men never go
oh blame it on midnight
ooh shame on the moon
everywhere its all around
comfort in a crowd
strangers faces all around
laughin right out loud
hey watch where your goin
step light on old toes
cause until youve been beside a man
you dont know who he knows
oh blame it on midnight
ooh shame on the moon
oh blame it on midnight
ooh shame on the moon
here's a little song i wrote
you might want to sing it note for note
don't worry be happy
in every life we have some trouble
but when you worry you make it double
don't worry be happy
don't worry be happy now
don't worry be happy don't worry be happy
don't worry be happy don't worry be happy
ain't got no place to lay your head
somebody came and took your bed
don't worry be happy
the landlord say your rent is late
he may have to litigate
don't worry be happy
look at me i'm happy
don't worry be happy
here i give you my phone number when you worry call me
don't worry be happy
ain't got no cash ain't got no style
ain't got no gal to make you smile
don't worry be happy
'cause when you worry your face will frown
and that will bring everybody down
don't worry be happy
don't worry be happy now
don't worry be happy don't worry be happy
don't worry be happy don't worry be happy
don't worry don't worry don't do it
be happy put a smile on your face
don't bring everybody down
don't worry it will soon pass whatever it is
don't worry be happy
i'm not worried i'm happy
e||
i guess this time you're really leaving
i heard your suitcase say goodbye
well as my broken heart lies bleeding
you say true love it's suicide
you say you cried a thousand rivers
and now you're swimming for the shore
you left me drowning in my tears
and you won't save me anymore
i pray to god you'll give me one more chance girl
i'll be there for you
these five words i swear to you
when you breathe i want to be the air for you
i'll be there for you
steal the sun from the sky for you
words can't say what a love can do
i'll be there for you
e||
i know you know we've had some good times
now they have their own hiding place
i can't promise you tomorrow
but i can't buy back yesterday
and baby you know my hands are dirty oh woman you know my hands are dirty
but i wanted to be your valentine
i'll be the water when you get thirsty baby
when you get drunk i'll be the wine
i'll be there for you
these five words i swear to you
when you breathe i want to be the air for you
i'll be there for you
steal the sun from the sky for you
words can't say what a love can do
i'll be there for you
and i wasn't there when you were happy i wasn't there to make you happy
i wasn't there when you were down
i didn't mean to miss your birthday baby
i wish i'd seen you blow those candles out scream
i'll be there for you
these five words i swear to you
when you breathe i want to be the air for you
i'll be there for you
steal the sun from the sky for you
words can't say what a love can do
i'll be there for you
i'll be there for you
these five words i swear to you
when you breathe i want to be the air for you

on the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
they're made of lipstick plastic and paint a touch of sable in your eyes
all your life all your life all you've asked is when's your daddy gonna talk to you
you were living in another world trying to get a message through
no one heard a single word you said
they should've seen it in your eyes
what was going around your head
ooooh she's a little runaway
daddy's girl learned fast all those things he could'nt say
ooooh she's a little runaway
a different line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
see you out in the streets call me for a wild time
so you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
there's only pictures hung in the shadows there for them to look at you
you know she likes the lights at night on the neon broadway sign
she don't really mind it's only love she hopes to find
ooooh she's a little runaway
daddy's girl learned fast all those he could'nt say
ooooh she's a little runaway
no one heard a single word you said
they should've seen it in your eyes
what was going around your head
it's all the same only the names will change
and ev'ry day it seems we're wasting away
another place where the faces are so cold
i'd drive all night just to get back home
i'm a cowboy on a steel horse i ride
i'm wanted dead or alive
wanted dead or alive
sometimes i sleep sometimes it's not for days
and people i meet always go their separate ways
sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
and times when you're alone and all you do is think
i'm a cowboy on a steel horse i ride
i'm wanted dead or alive
wanted dead or alive
ooooh and i'm a cowboy on a steel horse i ride
i'm wanted wanted dead or alive
and i walk these streets a loaded six string on my back
i play for keeps 'cause i might not make it back
i been everywhere still i'm standing tall
i've seen a million faces and i've rocked them all
'cause i'm a cowboy on a steel horse i ride
i'm wanted wanted dead or alive
well i'm a cowboy i got the night on my side
i'm wanted wanted dead or alive
dead or alive dead or alive
dead or alive i still ride still ride
dead or alive dead or alive
dead or alive dead or alive
dead or alive dead or alive
an angel's smile is what you sell you promise me heaven then put me through hell
chains of love got a hold on me when passion's a prison you can't break free

shot through the heart and you're to blame you give love a bad name bad name

no one can save me the damage is done
shot through the heart and you're to blame you give love a bad name bad name

i was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
i'd sit on his lap in that big old buick and steer as we drove through town
he'd tousle my hair and he'd say son take a good look around
this is your hometown your home town
this is your hometown your home town this is your home town
in tension was running high at my high school
there was a lot of fights between the black and white there was nothing you could do
two cars at a light on a saturday night in the back seat was a gun
words were passed a shotgun blast troubled times had come
to my hometown my home town
my hometown my home town my hometown
now main street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
they're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back to
your hometown your home town
your hometown your home town your hometown
last night me and kate we laid in bed talking about getting out
packing up our bags maybe heading south
i'm thirtyfive we got a boy of our own now
last night i sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around
this is your hometown your home town
your hometown your home town your hometown
you better watch out you better not cry
you better not pout i'm telling you why
santa claus is coming to town
santa claus is coming to town
santa claus is coming to town
he's making a list and checking it twice
he’s gonna find out who's naughty or nice
santa claus is coming to town
santa claus is coming to town
santa claus is coming to town
he sees you when you're sleeping
he knows when you're awake
he knows if you've been bad or good
you better be good for goodness sake
you better watch out you better not cry
you better not pout i'm telling you why
santa claus is coming to town
santa claus is coming to town
santa claus is coming to town
he sees you when you're sleeping

i come from down in the valley where mister when you're young
they bring you up to do like your daddy done
me and mary we met in high school when she was just seventeen
we'd drive out of this valley down to where the fields were green
we'd go down to the river and into the river we'd dive
oh down to the river we’d ride
then i got mary pregnant and man that was all she wrote
and for my birthday i got a union card and a wedding coat
we went down to the courthouse and the judge put it all to rest
no wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
no flowers no wedding dress
that night we went down to the river
and into the river we'd dive
oh down to the river we did ride
e||
e||
i got a job working construction for the johnstown company
but lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
now all them things that seemed so important
well mister they vanished right into the air
now i just act like i don't remember mary acts like she don't care
but i remember us riding in my brother's car her body tan and wet down at
the reservoir at night on them banks i'd lie awake
and pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
now those memories come back to haunt me
they haunt me like a curse
is a dream a lie if it don't come true or is it something worse
that sends me down to the river though i know the river is dry
that sends me down to the river tonight
down to the river my baby and i
oh down to the river we ride ooh
the screen door slams mary's dress sways
like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
roy orbison singing for the lonely
hey that's me and i want you only
don't turn me home again i just can't face myself alone again
don't run back inside darling you know just what i'm here for
that maybe we ain't that young anymore
show a little faith there's magic in the night
you ain't a beauty but hey you're alright
oh and that's alright with me
you can hide neath your covers and study your pain
make crosses from your lovers throw roses in the rain
waste your summer praying in vain
for a saviour to rise from these streets
well now i'm no hero that's understood
all the redemption i can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood
with a chance to make it good somehow
hey what else can we do now
except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
these two lanes will take us anywhere
we got one last chance to make it real
to trade in these wings on some wheels
climb in back heaven's waiting down on the tracks
oh oh come take my hand
we re riding out tonight to case the promised land
oh oh oh oh thunder road oh thunder road oh thunder road
lying out there like a killer in the sun
hey i know it's late we can make it if we run
oh oh oh oh thunder road sit tight take hold thunder road
well i got this guitar and i learned how to make it talk
and my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
from your front porch to my front seat
the door's open but the ride it ain't free
and i know you're lonely for words that i ain't spoken
but tonight we'll be free all the promises'll be broken
there were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
in the skeleton frames of burned out chevrolets
they scream your name at night in the street
your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet and in the
lonely cool before dawn you hear their engines roaring on but when you
get to the porch they're gone on the wind so mary climb in
it's a town full of losers and i'm pulling out of here to win
the screen door slams mary's dress waves
like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
roy orbison singing for the lonely
hey that's me and i want you only
don't turn me home again i just can't face myself alone again
don't run back inside darling you know just what i'm here for
that maybe we ain't that young anymore
show a little faith there's magic in the night
you ain't a beauty but hey you're alright

your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
and in the lonely cool before dawn you hear their engines roaring on
until you get to the porch they're gone on the wind so mary climb in

but i want you to know i'll walk it for you any time
maybe your other boyfriends

well if you're rough and ready for love
honey i'm tougher than the rest
the road is dark
and it's a thin thin line
but i want you to know i'll walk it for you any time
maybe your other boyfriends
couldn't pass the test
well if you're rough and ready for love

how does a moment last forever
how can a story never die
it is love we must hold onto
never easy but we try
sometimes our happiness is captured
somehow our time and place stand still
love lives on inside our hearts
and always will
minutes turn to hours
days to years and gone
but when all else has been forgotten
still our song lives on
maybe some moments weren’t so perfect
maybe some memories not so sweet
but we have to know some bad times
or our lives are incomplete
then when the shadows overtake us
just when we feel all hope is gone
we’ll hear our song and know once more
our love lives on
how does a moment last forever
how does our happiness endure
through the darkest of our troubles
love is beauty love is pure
love pays no mind to desolation
it flows like a river through the soul
protects persists and perseveres
and makes us whole
minutes turn to hours
days to years and gone
but when all else has been forgotten
still our song lives on
that's how a moment lasts forever
when our song lives on
i look in your eyes and i can
see
we've loved so dangerously
you're not trusting your heart
to anyone
you tell me you're gonna play
it smart
we're through before we start
but i believe that we've only
just begun
when it's this good there's no
saying no
i want you so i'm ready to go
through the fire to the limit
to the wall
for a chance to be with you
i'd gladly risk it all
through the fire
through whatever come what may
for a chance at loving you
i'd take it all the way
right down to the wire
even through the fire
i know you're afraid of what
you feel
you still need time to heal
and i can help if you'll only
let me try
you touch me and something in
me knew
what i could have with you
now i'm not ready
to kiss that dream goodbye
when it's this sweet there's
no saying no
i need you so i'm ready to go
through the fire to the limit
to the wall
for a chance to be with you
i'd gladly risk it all
through the fire
through whatever come what may
for a chance at loving you
i'd take it all the way
right down to the wire
even through the fire
through the test of time
through the fire to the limit
to the wall
for a chance to be with you
i'd gladly risk it all
through the fire
through whatever come what may
for a chance at loving you
i'd take it all the way
right down to the wire
even through the fire
to the wire to the limit
through the fire through
whatever
through the fire to the limit
through the fire through
whatever
another night slowly closes in
and it feels so lonely
touching heat freezing on my skin
i pretend you still hold me
i'm going crazy i'm losing sleep
i'm in too far i'm in way too deep over you
i can't believe you're gone
you were the first you'll be the last
wherever you go i'll be with you
whatever you want i'll give it to you
whenever you need someone to lay your heart
and head upon remember
after the fire after all the rain
i will be the flamei will be the flame
watching shadows move across the wall
i feel so frightened
i wanna run to you i wanna call
but i've been hit by lightening
just can't stand up for fallin' apart
can't see through this veil across my heart over you
you'll always be the one
you were the first you'll be the last
wherever you go i'll be with you
whatever you want i'll give it to you
whenever you need someone to lay your heart
and head upon remember
after the fire after all the rain
i will be the flamei will be the flame
i'm going crazy i'm losing sleep
i'm in too far i'm in way too deep over you
you'll always be the one
you were the first you'll be the last
wherever you go i'll be with you
whatever you want i'll give it to you
wherever you go i'll be with you
whatever you want i'll give it to you
i've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
i've never seen you shine so bright ooo ooo
i've never seen so many men asking if you wanted to dance
they're looking for a little romance given half a chance
and i have never seen that dress you're wearing
or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
i have been blind
the lady in red is dancing with me cheek to cheek
there's nobody here it's just you and me
it's where i want to be
but i hardly know this beauty by my side
i'll never forget the way you look tonight
i've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
i've never seen you shine so bright you were amazing
i've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
and when you turned to me and smiled it took my breath away
and i have never had such a feeling
such a feeling of complete and utter love as i do tonight
the lady in red is dancing with me cheek to cheek
there's nobody here it's just you and me
it's where i want to be
but i hardly know this beauty by my side
i'll never forget the way you look tonight
the lady in red my lady in red my lady in red my lady in
red
the world was on fire and no one could save me but you
it's strange what desire will make foolish people do
i never dreamed that i'd meet somebody like you
i never dreamed that i'd lose somebody like you
no i don't want to fall in love this world is only gonna break your heart
no i don't want to fall in love this world is only gonna break your heart
what a wicked game to play to make me feel this way
what a wicked thing to do to let me dream of you
what a wicked thing to say you never felt this way
what a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you
and i don't want to fall in love this world is only gonna break your heart
no i don't want to fall in love this world is only gonna break your heart
the world was on fire and no one could save me but you
it's strange what desire will make foolish people do
i never dreamed that i'd love somebody like you
i never dreamed that i'd lose somebody like you no
no i want to fall in love this world is only gonna break your heart
no i want to fall in love this world is only gonna break your heart
nobody loves no one
i'm driving home for christmas
oh i can't wait to see those faces
i'm driving home for christmas yea
well i'm moving down that line
and it's been so long
but i will be there
i sing this song
to pass the time away
driving in my car
driving home for christmas
it's gonna take some time
but i'll get there
top to toe in tailbacks
oh i got red lights all around
but soon there'll be a freeway
get my feet on holy ground
so i sing for you
though you can't hear me
when i get through
oh and feel you near me
driving in my car
i am driving home for christmas
driving home for christmas
with a thousand memories
i take look at the driver next to me
he's just the same
just the same
top to toe in tailbacks
oh i got red lights all around
i'm driving home for christmas yea
get my feet on holy ground
so i sing for you
though you can't hear me
when i get through
oh and feel you near me
driving in my car
driving home for christmas
driving home for christmas
with a thousand memories
i take a look at the driver next to me
he's just the same
he's driving home driving home
driving home for christmas
well i'm standing by a river
but the water doesn't flow
it boils with every poison
you can think of
and i'm underneath the street light
the delight of joy i know
scared beyond belief
way down in the shadows
and the perverted fear of violence
chokes a smile on every face
common sense is ringing out the bells
this ain't no technological breakdown
oh no this is the road to hell
and all the roads jam up with credit
and there's nothing you can do
it's all just bits of paper
flying away from you
oh look out world take a good look
look who's down there
you must learn this lesson fast and learn it well
this ain't no upwardly mobile freeway
oh no this is the road
this is the road
this is the road to hell
play and fade out
i can't tell you baby what went wrong
i can't make you feel what you felt so long ago
i let it show
i can't give you back what's been hurt
heartaches come and go and all that's left are the wounds
i can't let go
if we take some time think it over baby
take some time let me know if you really want to gooo
don't know what you got till it's gone
don't know what it is i did so wrooong
now i know what i've got it's just this song
and it ain't easy to get back takes so lo oong
i can't feel the things that cause you pain
i can't clear my heart of your love it falls like rain
ain't the same
i hear you calling far away
tearin' through my soul i just can't take another day
who's to blame
if we take some time think it over baby
take some time let me know if you really want to gooo
don't know what you got till it's gone
don't know what it is i did so wrooong
now i know what i've got it's just this song
and it ain't easy to get back takes so lo oong
do you wanna see me beggin' baby
can't you give me just one more day
can't you see my heart's been draggin' lately
i've been lookin for the words to saaay
don't know what you got till it's gone
don't know what it is i did so wrooong
now i know what i've got it's just this song
and it ain't easy to get back takes so lo oong
don't know what you got till it's gone
don't know what it is i did so wrooong
now i know what i've got it's just this so oong
and it ain't easy to get back takes so lo oong
fade out
the kids are driving and saturday afternoon just passed me by
i'm just savouring familiar sights
we shared some history this town and i
and i can't stop that longforgotten feeling of her
in time to book a room and stay tonight
number is to find some friends and say "you're doing well
after all this time you boys look just the same"
number is the happy hour at one of two hotels
and settle in to play "do you remember soandso"
number is never say her name
and oh the flame trees'll blind a weary driver
and there's nothing that can set fire to this town
there's no change there's no pace everything within its place
just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around
oh who needs that sentimental bullshit anyway
it takes more than just a memory to make me cry
and i'm happy just to sit here at a table with old friends
and see which one of us can tell the biggest lies
and there's a girl she's fallin' in love near where the pianola stands
with a young local factory auto worker just holdin' hands
and i'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay
do you remember nothing stopped us on the field in our day
and oh the flame trees'll blind a weary driver
and there's nothing that can set fire to this town
there's no change there's no pace everything within its place
just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around
and oh the flame trees'll blind a weary driver
and there's nothing that can set fire to this town
there's no change there's no pace everything within its place
just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around
ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
when the war is over got to get away
pack my bag to no place in no time no day
you and i we used each other's shoulder
still so young but somehow so much older
how can i go home and not get blown away
e||
e||
e||
e||
you and i had our sights set on something
hope this doesn't mean our days are numbered
i've got plans for more than a wanted man
all around this chaos and madness
can't help feeling nothing more than sadness
only choice to face it the best i can
when the war is over got to start again
try to hold a trace of what it was back then
you and i we sent each other stories
just a page i'm lost in all it's glory
how can i go home and not get blown away
ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
e||
ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away

got outta town on a boat for the southern islands
sailing a reach before a following sea
she was making for the trades on the outside
and the downhill run to papeete bay
off this wind on this heading lie the marqueses
we got eighty feet of the waterline nicely making way
in a noisy bar in avalon i tried to call you
but on a midnight watch i realized why twice you ran away
think about
think about how many times i have fallen
spirits are using me larger voices calling
what heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten
i have been around the world
looking for that woman girl
who knows love can endure
and you know it will
and you know it will
when you see the southern cross for the first time
you understand now why you came this way
cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small
but it's as big as the promise
the promise of a coming day
so i'm sailing for tommorrow my dreams are a dying
and my love is an anchor tied to you
tied with a silver chain
i have my ship and all her flags are a flying
she is all that i have left
and music is her name
think about
think about how many times i have fallen
spirits are using me larger voices calling
what heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten
i have been around the world
looking for that woman girl
who knows love can endure
and you know it will
and you know it will
so we cheated and we lied and we tested
and we never failed to fail
it was the easiest thing to do
you will survive being bested
somebody fine will come along
make me forget about loving you
somewhere deep inside
something's got a hold on you
and it's pushing me aside
see it stretch on forever
and i know i'm right
for the first time in my life
that's why i tell you
you'd better be home soon
stripping back the coats
of lies and deception
back to nothingness
like a week in the desert
and i know i'm right
for the first time in my life
that's why i tell you
you'd better be home soon
so don't say no don't say nothing's wrong
cos when you get back home maybe i'll be gone
it would cause me pain
if we were to end it
but i could start again
you can depend on it
and i know i'm right
for the first time in my life
that's why i tell you
you'd better be home soon
that's why i tell you
you'd better be home soon

there is freedom within there is freedom without
try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
there's a battle ahead many battles are lost
but you'll never see the end of the road
while you're travelling with me
hey now hey now don't dream it's over
hey now hey now when the world comes in
they come they come to build a wall between us
we know they won't win
now i'm towing my car there's a hole in the roof
my possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
in the paper today tales of war and of waste
but you turn right over to the tv page
hey now hey now don't dream it's over
hey now hey now when the world comes in
they come they come to build a wall between us
we know they won't win
now i'm walking again to the beat of a drum
and i'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
only the shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
get to know the feeling of liberation and release
hey now hey now don't dream it's over
hey now hey now when the world comes in
they come they come to build a wall between us
we know that they won't win
repeat
desert love in your eyes all the way
if i listen to your lies would you say
i'm a man without conviction
i'm a man who doesn't know
how to sell a contracdiction
you come and go
you come and go
karma karma karma karma karma chameleon
you come and go
you come and go
loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
red gold and green
red gold and green
didn't hear your wicked words every day
and you used to be so sweet i heard you say
that my love was an addiction
when we cling our love is strong
when you go you're gone forever
you string along
you string along
karma karma karma karma karma chameleon
you come and go
you come and go
loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
red gold and green
red gold and green
every day is like a survival
you're my lover not my rival
every day is like a survival
you're my lover not my rival
i'm a man without conviction
i'm a man who doesn't know
how to sell a contracdiction
you come and go
you come and go
karma karma karma karma karma chameleon
you come and go
you come and go
loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
red gold and green

i i just died in your arms tonight
it must've been something you said
i just died in your arms tonight no drums until this part
i keep looking for something i can't get
broken hearts lie all around me and
i don't see an easy way to get out of this
her diary it sits by the bedside table
the curtains are closed the cat's in the cradle
who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this
oooh i i just died in your arms tonight
it must've been something you said
i just died in your arms tonight oooh
i i just died in your arms tonight
it must've been some kind of kiss
i should've walked away
i should've walked away
is there any just cause for feeling like this
on the surface i'm a name on a list
i try to be discreet then blow it again
i'm lost and found it's my final mistake
she's loving by proxy no give and all take
'cause i've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times
oooh i i just died in your arms tonight
it must've been something you said
i just died in your arms tonight oooh
i i just died in your arms tonight
it must've been some kind of kiss
i should've walked away
i should've walked away
it was a long hot night
she made it easy she made it feel right
but now it's over the moment has gone i
followed my heart not my head i know i was wrong
i i just died in your arms tonight
it must've been something you said
i just died in your arms tonight no drums until this part
i i just died in your arms tonight
it must've been some kind of kiss
i should've walked away
i should've walked away
i come home in the morning light
my mother says 'when you gonna live your life right'
oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
and girls they want to have fun
oh girls just want to have fun
the phone rings in the middle of the night
my father yells 'what you gonna do with your life'
oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
but girls they want to have fun
oh girls just want to have
that's all they really want
some fun
when the working day is done
oh girls they want to have fun
oh girls just want to have fun
some boys take a beautiful girl
and hide her away from the rest of the world
i want to be the one to walk in the sun
oh girls just want to have fun
oh girls just want to have
they just wanna they just wanna
they just wanna they just wanna
girls girls just want to have fun
lyin' in my bed i hear the clock tick and think of you
caught up in circles confusion is nothing new
flash back warm nights almost left behind
suitcase of memories time after
if you're lost you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting
time after time
e||
e||
time after time
e||
e||
e||

you with the sad eyes
don't be discouraged
oh i realize
it's hard to take courage
in a world full of people
you can lose sight of it all
and the darkness inside you
can make you feel so small
but i see your true colors
shining through
i see your true colors
and that's why i love you
so don't be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors are beautiful
like a rainbow
show me a smile then
don't be unhappy can't remember
when i last saw you laughing
if this world makes you crazy
and you've taken all you can bear
you call me up
because you know i'll be there
and i'll see your true colors
shining through
i see your true colors
and that's why i love you
so don't be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors are beautiful
like a rainbow
an only child alone and wild a cabinet maker's son
his hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none
he left his home and went his lone and solitary way
and he gave to me a gift i know i never can repay
a quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
he tried to be a soldier once but his music wouldn't wait
he earned his love through discipline a thund'ring velvet hand
his gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand
the leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
but his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
my life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
i'm just a living legacy to the lea der of the band
my brothers' lives were different for they heard another call
one went to chicago the other to st paul
and i'm in colorado when i'm not in some hotel
living out this life i chose and come to know so well
i thank you for the music and your stories of the road
i thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
i thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
and papa i don't think i said "i love you" near enough
the leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
but his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
my life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
i'm just a living legacy to the lea der of the band
i am the living legacy to the leader of the band

met my old lover in a grocery store
the snow was falling christmas eve
i stole behind her in the frozen foods
and i touched her on her sleeve
she didn't recognize the face at first
but then her eyes flew open wide
she went to hug me and she spilled her purse
and we laughed until we cried
we took her groceries to the checkout stand
the food was totaled up and bagged
we stood there lost in our embarrassment
as the conversation dragged
went to have ourselves a drink or two
but couldn't find and open bar
we bought a sixpack at the liquor store
and we drank it in her car
we drank a toast to innocence
we drank a toast to now
tried to reach beyond the emptiness
but neither one knew how
she said she'd married her an architect
who kept her warm and safe and dry
she would have liked to say she loved the man
but she didn't want to lie
i said the years had been a friend to her
and that her eyes were still as blue
but in those eyes i wasn't sure if i
saw doubt or gratitude
she said she saw me in the record stores
and that i must be doing well
i said the audience was heavenly
but the travelling was hell
we drank a toast to innocence
we drank a toast to now
tried to reach beyond the emptiness
but neither one knew how
we drank a toast to innocence
we drank a toast to time
reliving in our eloquence
another "auld lang syne"
the beer was empty and our tongues were tired
and running out of things to say
she gave a kiss to me as i got out
and i watched her drive away
just for a moment i was back at school
and felt that old familiar pain
and as i turned to make my way back home
the snow turned into rain
true love will find you in the end
you'll find out just who was your friend
don't be sad i know you will
but dont give up until
true love will find you in the end
this is a promise with a catch
only if your looking can it find you
cause true love is searching too
but how can it recognise you
unless you step out into the light the light
don't be sad i know you will
don't give up until true love will find you in the end
there's such a sad love
deep in your eyes a kind of pale jewel
open and closed within your eyes
i'll place the sky within your eyes
there's such a fooled heart
beating so fast in search of new dreams
a love that will last within your heart
i'll place the moon within your heart
as the pain sweeps through
makes no sense for you
every thrill is gone
wasn't too much fun at all
but i'll be there for youoooo
as the world falls down
falling
as the world falling down
falling in love
i'll paint you mornings of gold
i'll spin you valentine evenings
though we're strangers till now
we're choosing the path between the stars
i'll lay my love between the stars
as the pain sweeps through
makes no sense for you
every thrill is gone
wasn't too much fun at all
but i'll be there for youoooo
as the world falls down
do you remember a guy that's been
in such an early song
i've heard a rumour from ground control
oh no don't say it's true
they got a message from the action man
i'm happy hope you're happy too
i've loved and i've needed love
sordid details following
the shrieking of nothing is killing me
just pictures of jap girls in synthesis and i
ain't got no money and i ain't got no hair
but i'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing
ashes to ashes funk to funky
we know major tom's a junkie
strung out in heaven's high
hitting an alltime low
time and again i tell myself
i'll stay clean tonight
but the little green wheels are following me
oh no not again
i'm stuck with a valuable friend
i'm happy hope you're happy too
one flash of light but no smoking pistol
i've never done good things
i've never done bad things
i never did anything out of the blue wohohoh
want an axe to break the ice
wanna come down right now
ashes to ashes funk to funky
we know major tom's a junkie
strung out in heaven's high
hitting an alltime low
my mother said to get things done
you'd better not mess with major tom
my mother said to get things done
you'd better not mess with major tom
my mother said to get things done
you'd better not mess with major tom
my mother said to get things done
you'd better not mess with major tom
fade out
ah ah ah ah
let's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues
let's dance to the song they're playin' on the radio
let's sway while color lights up your face
let's sway sway through the crowd to an empty space
if you say run i'll run with you
if you say hide we'll hide
because my love for you would break my heart in two
if you should fall into my arms and tremble like a
flower
let's dance
let's dance for fear your grace should fall
let's dance for fear tonight is all
let's sway you could look into my eyes
let's sway under the moonlight this serious moonlight
if you say run i'll run with you
if you say hide we'll hide
because my love for you would break my heart in two
if you should fall into my arms and tremble like a
flower
let's dance
let's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues
let's sway under the moonlight the serious moonlight

can you remember remember my name as i flow through
your life a thousand oceans i have flown ooh and
cold cold spirits of ice
all my life i am the echo of your past
i am returning the echo of a point in time distant faces
shine a thousand warriors i have known and
laughing as the spirits appear
all your life shadows of another day
and if you hear me talking
on the wind you've got to understand we must re
main perfect strangers
i know i must remain inside this silent well of
sorrow
a strand of silver hanging through the sky touching more than you
see the voice of ages in your mind oooh is
aching with the death of the night o oooh
aww precious life your tears are lost in falling rain
and if you hear me talking
on the wind you've got to understand we must re
main perfect strangers

my way of thinking in fact she'll often disagree but in the

help me see things in a different light all the things i detest i will almost like

i can't do everything but i'd do anything for you
i can't do anything except be in love with you
and all i do is miss you and the way we used to be
all i do is keep the beat and bad company

i'll be home with bells on i'll be home with bells on
trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the christmas music on
this christmas i'll be home with bells on
i've traveled around this country crossed the waters deep and wide
made lots of friends and memories brought joy to others’ lives
it's christmas time again another year has come and gone
and i can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home
i'll be home with bells on i'll be home with bells on
trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the christmas music on
this christmas i'll be home with bells on
when the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
and the kids are singing jingle bells around the christmas lights
as daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
there ain't nothing going to slow me down this christmas i'll be home
i'll be home with bells on i'll be home with bells on
trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the christmas music on
this christmas i'll be home with bells on
i'll be home with bells on i'll be home with bells on

nobody on the road nobody on the beach
i feel it in the air the summer's out of reach
empty lake empty streets the sun goes down alone
i'm driving by your house though i know you're not home
but i can see you your brown skin shining in the sun
you got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on baby
i can tell you my love for you will still be strong
after the boys of summer have gone
i never will forget those nights i wonder if it was a dream
remember how you made me crazy remember how i made you scream
now i don't understand what happened to our love
but babe i'm gonna get you back i'm gonna show you what i'm made of
i can see you your brown skin shining in the sun
i see you walkin' real slow and smiling to everyone
i can tell you my love for you will still be strong
after the boys of summer have gone
out on the road today i saw a deadhead sticker on a cadillac
a little voice inside my head said "don't look back you can never look back"
i thought i knew what love was what did i know
those days are gone forever i should just let 'em go but
i can see you your brown skin shining in the sun
you got the top pulled down and radio on baby
i can tell you my love for you will still be strong
after the boys of summer have gone
i can see you your brown skin shining in the sun
you got your hair slicked back and those wayfarers on baby
i can tell you my love for you will still be strong
after the boys of summer have gone
i don't believe in superstars organic food or foreign cars
i don't believe the price of gold the certainty of growing old
that right is right and left is wrong that north and south can't get along
that east is east and west is west and being first is always best
but i believe in love i believe in babies
i believe in mom and dad and i believe in you
i don't believe that heaven waits for only those who congregate
i like to think of god as love he's down below he's up above
he's watching people everywhere he knows who does and doesn't care
and i'm an ordinary man sometimes i wonder who i am
but i believe in love i believe in music
i believe in magic and i believe in you
well i know with all my certainty what's going on with you and me
is a good thing it's true i believe in you
i don't believe virginity is as common as it used to be
in working days and sleeping nights that black is black and white is white
that superman and robin hood are still alive in hollywood
that gasoline's in short supply the rising cost of getting by
but i believe in love i believe in old folks
i believe in children and i believe in you
but i believe in love i believe in babies
i believe in mom and dad and i believe in you
dark in the city night is a wire steam in the subway the earth is afire

moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise
cherry ice cream smile i suppose it's very nice
with a step to your left and a flick to the right
you catch that mirror way out west
you know you're something special and you look like you're the best
her name is rio and she dances on the sand
just like that river twisting though the dusty land
and when she shines she really shows you all she can
oh rio rio dance across the rio grande
i've seen you on the beach and i've seen you on tv
two of a billion stars it means so much to me
like a birthday or a pretty view
but then i'm sure that you know it's just for you
her name is rio and she dances on the sand
just like that river twisting through a dusty land
and when she shines she really shows you all she can
oh rio rio dance across the rio grande
hey now woo look at that did she nearly run you down
at the end of the drive the lawmen arrive
you make me feel alive alive alive
i'll take my chance cause luck is on my side or something
i know what you're thinking
i tell you something i know what you're thinking
her name is rio and she dances on the sand
just like that river twists across the dusty land
and when she shines she really shows you all she can
oh rio rio dance across the rio grande
her name is rio she don't need to understand
and i might find her if i'm looking like i can
oh rio rio hear them shout across the land
from mountains in the north down to the rio grande
do do do do dedo do do do do dedo

there are stars
in the southern sky
southward as you go
there is moonlight
and moss in the trees
down the seven bridges road
now i have loved you like a baby
like some lonesome child
and i have loved you in a tame way
and i have loved you wild
sometimes there's a part of me
has to turn from here and go
running like a child from these warm stars
down the seven bridges road
under blue moon i saw you so soon you'll take me
up in your arms to late to beg you or cancel it though i know it must be
the killing time unwillingly mine
fate up against your will through the thick and thin
he will wait until you give yourself to him
in starlit nights i saw you so cruelly you kissed me
your lips a magic world the sky all hung with jewels
the killing moon will come too soon
fate up against your will through the thick and thin
he will wait until you give yourself to him
under blue moon i saw you so soon you'll take me
up in your arms to late to beg you or cancel it though i know it must be
the killing time unwillingly mine
fate up against your will through the thick and thin
he will wait until you give yourself to him
fate up against your will through the thick and thin
he will wait until you give yourself to him you give yourself to him
fate up against your will through the thick and thin
he will wait until you give yourself to him you give yourself to him
fate up against your will through the thick and thin
he will wait until you give your self to him
fate up against your will through the thick and thin
he will wait until you give yourself to him

what i am is what i am you
what you are or what
what i am is what i am you

there's a calm surrender
to the rush of day
when the heat of a rolling wind
can be turned away
an enchanted moment
and it sees me through
it's enough for this restless warrior
just to be with you
and can you feel the love tonight
it is where we are
it's enough for this wideeyed wanderer
that we got this far
and can you feel the love tonight
how it's laid to rest
it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
believe the ve ry best
there's a time for everyone
if they only learn
that the twisting kaleidoscope
moves us all in turn
there's a rhyme and reason
to the wild outdoors
when the heart of this starcrossed voyager
beats in time with yours
and can you feel the love tonight
it is where we are
it's enough for this wideeyed wanderer
that we got this far
and can you feel the love tonight
how it's laid to rest
it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
believe the ve ry best
it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
believe the ve ry best
don't wish it away
don't look at it's like it's forever
between you and me
i could honestly say
that things can only get better
and while i'm away
dust out the demons inside
and it won't be long
before you and me run
to the place in our hearts
where we hide
and i guess that's why
they call it the blues
time on my hands
could be time spent with you
laughing like children
living like lovers
rolling like thunder under the covers
and i guess that's why
they call it the blues
just stare into space
picture my face in your hands
live for each second
without hesitation
and never forget i'm your man
wait on me girl
cry in the night if it helps
but more than ever i simply love you
more than i love life itself
and i guess that's why
they call it the blues
time on my hands
could be time spent with you
laughing like children
living like lovers
rolling like thunder under the covers
and i guess that's why
they call it the blues
wait on me girl
cry in the night if it helps
but more than ever i simply love you
more than i love life itself
and i guess that's why
they call it the blues
time on my hands
could be time spent with you
laughing like children
living like lovers
rolling like thunder under the covers
and i guess that's why
they call it the blues
and i guess that's why
they call it the blues
you could never know what it's like
your blood like winter freezes just like ice
and there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
you'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
and did you think this fool could never win
well look at me i'm coming back again
i got a taste of love in a simple way
and if you need to know while i'm still standing you just fade a way
don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did
looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid
i'm still standing after all this time
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
once i never could hope to win
you starting down the road leaving me again
the threats you made were meant to cut me down
and if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now
don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did
looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid
i'm still standing after all this time
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did
looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid
i'm still standing after all this time
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah repeat and fade to the end
it's a human sign
when things go wrong
when the scent of her lingers
and temptation's strong
into the boundary
of each married man
sweet deceit comes calling
and negativity lands
cold cold heart
hard done by you
some things look better baby
just passing through
and it's no sacrifice
just a simple word
it's two hearts living
in two separate worlds
but it's no sacrifice
no sacrifice
it's no sacrifice at all
mutual misunderstanding
after the fact
sensitivity builds a prison
in the final act
we lose direction
no stone unturned
no tears to damn you
when jealousy burns
cold cold heart
hard done by you
some things look better baby
just passing through
and it's no sacrifice
just a simple word
it's two hearts living
in two separate worlds
but it's no sacrifice
no sacrifice
it's no sacrifice at all
cold cold heart
hard done by you
some things look better baby
just passing through
and it's no sacrifice
just a simple word
it's two hearts living
in two separate worlds
but it's no sacrifice
no sacrifice
it's no sacrifice at all
no sacrifice at all
no sacrifice at all
no sacrifice at all
no sacrifice at all
i try to discover
a little something to make me sweeter
oh baby refrain from breaking my heart
i'm so in love with you
i'll be forever blue
that you give me no reason
why you're making me work so hard
that you give me no
soul i hear you calling
oh baby please give a little respect to me
and if i should falter
would you open your arms out to me
we can make love not war
and live at peace with our hearts
i'm so in love with you
i'll be forever blue
what religion or reason
could drive a man to forsake his lover
don't you tell me no
soul i hear you calling
oh baby please give a little respect to me
i'm so in love with you
i'll be forever blue
that you give me no reason
why you're making me work so hard
that you give me no
soul i hear you calling
oh baby please give a little respect to me
soul i hear you calling
oh baby please give a little respect to me

when i`m lying in bed
there's too much confusion
going around through my head
and it makes me so angry
to know that the flame still burns
why can't i get over
when will i ever learn
old love leave me alone
old love go on home
i can see your face
but i know that it's not real
it's just an illusion
caused by how i used to feel
and it makes me so angry
to know that the flame will always burn
i'll never get over
i know now that i'll never learn
old love leave me alone
old love go on home

what else can a poor boy do
but my world will be right
when love comes over you

one to take each and every day

bright eyes bright eyes

on croyait savoir tout sur l'amour depuis toujours
dans le velours
et puis te voilà bout de femme comme
soufflée d'une sarbacane
le ciel a même un autre éclat depuis toi
les hommes poursuivent ce temps qui court
depuis toujours
sur mon parcours
pendue à mon cou comme une liane
comm'le roseau d'la sarbacane
le ciel s'est ouvert par endroit depuis toi
pas besoin de phrases ni de longs discours
ça change tout dedans
ça change tout autour
finis les matins paupières en panne
lourdes comme les bouteilles de butane
j'ai presque plus ma tête à moi
depuis toi
pas besoin de faire de trop longs discours
ça change tout de dans ça change tout au tour
pourvu que jamais tu ne t'éloignes
plus loin qu'un jet de sarbacane
j'ai presque plus ma tête à moi
depuis toi
alors te voilà bout de femme
comme soufflée d'une sarbacane
le ciel s`est ouvert par endroit
depuis toi
oh depuis toi

you had to kill the conversation
you always had the upper hand
got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand
you had to go and ruin all our plans
packed your bags and you're leaving home
got a oneway ticket and you're all set to go
but we only have one more day together so
love me like there's no tomorrow
hold me in your arms tell me you mean it
this is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
but today just love me like there's no tomorrow
i guess we drift alone in separate ways
i don't have all that far to go
god knows i learnt to play the lonely man
i've never felt so low in all my life
we were born to be just losers
so i guess there's a limit on how far we go
but we only have one more day together so
love me like there's no tomorrow
hold me in your arms tell me you mean it
this is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
but today just love me like there's no tomorrow
tomorrow god knows just where i'll be
tomorrow who knows just what's in store for me
anything could happen but we only have one more day together yeah
just one more day forever
love me like there's no tomorrow
hold me in your arms tell me you mean it
this is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
but today just love me like there's no tomorrow
love me like there's no tomorrow
hold me in your arms tell me you mean it
this is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
but today just love me like there's no tomorrow
sometimes late at night
i lie awake and watch her sleeping
she's lost in peaceful dreams
so i turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
and the thought crosses my mind
if i never wake up in the morning
would she ever doubt the way i feel
about her in my heart
if tomorrow never comes
will she know how much i loved her
did i try in every way to show her every day
that she's my only one
and if my time on earth were through
and she must face this world without me
is the love i gave her in the past
gonna be enough to last
if tomorrow never comes
'cause i've lost love ones in my life
who never knew how much i loved them
now i live with the regret
that my true feelings for them never were revealed
so i made a promise to myself
to say each day how much she means to me
and avoid that circumstance
where there's no second chance to tell her how i feel
if tomorrow never comes
will she know how much i loved her
did i try in every way to show her every day
that she's my only one
and if my time on earth were through
and she must face this world without me
is the love i gave her in the past
gonna be enough to last
if tomorrow never comes
so tell that someone that you love
just what you`re thinking of
if tomorrow never comes
lookin back on the mem'ry of the dance we shared
'neath the stars above
for a moment all the world was right how could i have known
that you'd ever say good bye
and now i'm glad i didn't know the way it all would end
the way it all would go
our lives are better left to chance i could have missed the pain
but i'd have had to miss the dance
holding you i held everything for a moment
wasn't i the king
if i'd only known how the king would fall hey who's to say
you know i might have changed it all
and now i'm glad i didn't know the way it all would end
the way it all would go
our lives are better left to chance i could have missed the pain
but i'd have had to miss the dance
yes my life it's better left to chance
i could have have missed the pain
but i'd have had to miss the dance
pasko na sinta ko
hanaphanap kita
bakit nagtatampo
nilisan ako
kung mawawala ka
sa piling ko sinta
paano ang paskong
inulila mo
sayang sinta
ang sinumpaan
at pagtitinginang tunay
nais mo bang
kalimutang ganap
ang ating suyuan at galak
kung mawawala ka
sa piling ko sinta

alay ko sa 'yo
kung mawawala ka
sa piling ko sinta

at pagtitinginang tunay
nais mo bang
kalimutang ganap
ang ating suyuan at galak
kung mawawala ka
sa piling ko sinta

set on you

i feel so unsure
as i take your hand
and lead you to the dance floor
as the music dies
something in your eyes
calls to mind a silver screen
and all its sad goodbyes
i'm never gonna dance again
guilty feet have got no rhythm
though it's easy to pretend
i know you're not a fool
i should have known better than to cheat a friend
and waste a chance that i've been given
so i'm never gonna dance again
the way i danced with you
time can never mend
the careless whisper of a good friend
to the heart and mind
ignorance is kind
there's no comfort in the truth
pain is all you'll find
i'm never gonna dance again
guilty feet have got no rhythm
though it's easy to pretend
i know you're not a fool
i should have known better than to cheat a friend
and waste a chance that i've been given
so i'm never gonna dance again
the way i danced with you
tonight the music seems so loud
i wish that we could lose this crowd
maybe it's better this way
we'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
we could have been so good together
we could have lived this dance forever
but now who's gonna dance with me
please stay
i'm never gonna dance again
guilty feet have got no rhythm
though it's easy to pretend
i know you're not a fool
i should have known better than to cheat a friend
and waste a chance that i've been given
so i'm never gonna dance again
the way i danced with you
now that you've gone
now that you've gone
now that you've gone
was what i did so wrong
so wrong that you had to leave me alone

well i guess it would be nice
if i could touch your body
i know not everybody
has got a body like you
but i've got to think twice
before i give my heart away
and i know all the games you play
because i play them too
need some time off from that emotion
time to pick my heart up off the floor
oh when that love comes down
without devotion
well it takes a strong man baby
but i'm showing you the door
cause i gotta have faith faith faith
i gotta have faith
because i gotta have faith faith faith
i gotta have faith faith faith
baby
i know you're asking me to stay
say please please please don't go away
you say i'm giving you the blues
maybe
you mean every word you say
can't help but think of yesterday
and another who tied me down to loverboy rules
before this river
becomes an ocean
before you throw my heart back on the floor
oh baby i reconsider
my foolish notion
well i need someone to hold me
but i'll wait for something more
cause i gotta have faith faith faith
i gotta have faith
because i gotta have faith faith faith
i gotta have faith faith faith
before this river
becomes an ocean
before you throw my heart back on the floor
oh baby i reconsider
my foolish notion
well i need someone to hold me
but i'll wait for something more
cause i gotta have faith faith faith
i gotta have faith
because i gotta have faith faith faith
i gotta have faith faith faith

pienso que un sueno parecido no volvera mas
y me pintaba las manos lon cara de azul
y de improviso el viento rapido me llevo
y me hizo volar en cielo infinito
volare oh oh
cantare oh oh oh oh
nel blu dipinto di blu
felice di stare lassu
y volando volando feliz
yo me encuentro mas alto mas alto que el sol
mientras el mundo se aleja despacio de ti
una musica dulce tocada solo para mi
volare oh oh
cantare oh oh oh oh
nel blu dipinto di blu
felice di stare lassu
volare oh oh
cantare oh oh oh oh
nel blu dipinto di blu
felice di stare lassu
volare oh oh
cantare oh oh oh oh
nel blu dipinto di blu
felice di stare lassu
volare oh oh
cantare oh oh oh oh
nel blu dipinto di blu
felice di stare lassu

it's two am the fear has gone
i'm sitting here waiting the gun still warm
maybe my connection is tired of taking his chances
yeah there's a storm on the loose sirens in my head
wrapped in silence all circuits are dead
cannot decode my whole life spins into a frenzy
help i'm stepping into the twilight zone
place is a madhouse feels like being cloned
my beacon's been moved under moon and star
where am i to go now that i've gone too far
so you'll come to know when the bullet hits the bone
so you'll come to know when the bullet hits the bone
i'm falling down a spiral destination unknown
double crossed messenger all alone
can't get no connection can't get through where are you
well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
this far from the border line
when the hit man comes he knows damn well he has been cheated and he says
help i'm stepping into the twilight zone
place is a madhouse feels like being cloned
my beacon's been moved under moon and star
where am i to go now that i've gone too far
so you'll come to know when the bullet hits the bone
so you'll come to know when the bullet hits the bone

i told althea i was feeling lost lacking in some direction
althea told me upon scrutiny that my back might need protection
i told althea that treachery was tearing me limb from limb
althea told me better cool down boy settle back easy jim
you may be saturday's child all grown
moving with a pinch of grace
you may be a clown in the burying ground
or just another pretty face
you may be the fate of ophelia sleeping and perchance to dream
honest to the point of recklessness selfcentered in the extreme
ain't nobody messing with you but you
your friends are getting most concerned
loose with the truth baby it's your fire but baby don't get burned
when the smoke has cleared she said that's what she said to me
gonna want a bed to lay your head and a little sympathy
there are things you can replace and others you cannot
the time has come to weigh those things
this space is getting hot you know this space is getting hot
i told althea i'm a roving sign and i was born to be a bachelor
althea told me okay that's fine so now i'm trying to catch her
can't talk to you without talking to me
we're guilty of the same old thing
been thinking a lot about less and less
and forgetting the love we bring
i see the crystal raindrops fall
and the beauty of it all
is when the sun comes shining through
to make those rainbows in my mind
when i think of you sometime
and i want to spend some time with you
just the two of us we can make it if we try
just the two of us just the two of us
just the two of us building castles in the sky
just the two of us you and i
we look for love no time for tears
wasted water's all that is
and it don't make no flowers grow
good things might come to those who wait
but not for those who wait too late
we've got to go for all we know
just the two of us we can make it if we try
just the two of us just the two of us
just the two of us building castles in the sky
just the two of us you and i
i hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall
and it becomes the morning dew
and darling when the morning comes and i see the morning sun
i want to be the one with you
just the two of us we can make it if we try
just the two of us just the two of us
just the two of us building big castles way on high
just the two of us you and i

she's got a smile that it seems to me
reminds me of childhood memories
where everything
was as fresh as a bright blue sky
now and then when i see her face
she takes me away to that special place
and if i stared too long
i'd probably break down and cry
whoa oh sweet child o' mine
whoa oh oh oh sweet love o' mine
she's got eyes of the bluest skies
as if they thought of rain
i hate to look into those eyes
and see an ounce of pain
her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
where as a child i'd hide
and pray for the thunder and rain
to quietly pass me by
whoa oh oh sweet child o' mine
whoa oh oh oh sweet love o' mine
whoa oh sweet child o' mine
whoa oh oh oh sweet love o' mine

reachin' out for somethin' to hold
lookin' for a love where the climate is cold
manic moves drowsy dreams
livin' in the middle between the two extremes
smokin' guns hot to the touch
would cool down if we didn't use them so much yeah
we're soul alone and soul really matters to me

hey man them ain't high heeled sneakers
and they sure don't look like cowboy boots
and that ain't rock and roll you're playin'
and it sure ain't country or rhythm and blues
you're singin' a song about makin' love to your drummer
well gay guitarpickers don't turn me on
and we don't all get into donna summer
do you happen to know any old hank williams songs
'cause you see i'm a dinosaur
i should've died a long time before
have pity on a dinosaur
hand me my hat excuse me man but where's the door
it used to be i had a lotta fun in this old hangout
we'd get stoned at the jukebox and stay outta fights
now and then we'd light a little smoke in the truck out back
aww then a little old jim beam and we'd get right
and you know these flashing lights sure make me dizzy
and this disco's very strange to my ear
it looks like they've turned the longhorn into a spaceship
and i'll be leavin' just as soon as i finish this beer
'cause you see i'm a dinosaur
should've died a long time before
there's a whole lotta dinosaurs
give us our hats excuse me man but where's the door
get us our hats excuse me man where's the door
everybody's talking at me
i don't hear a word they're saying
only the echoes of my mind
people stopping staring
i can't see their faces
only the shadows of their eyes
i'm going where the sun keeps shining
thru' the pouring rain
going where the weather
suits my clothes
backing off of the north east wind
sailing on summer breeze
and skipping over the ocean like a stone
i hear the ticking of the clock i'm lying here the room's pitch dark
i wonder where you are tonight no answer on your telephone
and the night goes by so very slow
oh i hope that it won't end so
alone
till now i always got by on my own
i never really cared until i met you
and now it chills me to the bone
how do i get you alone
how do i get you alone
you don't know how long i have wanted
to touch your lips and hold you tight
you don't know how long i have waited
and i was gonna tell you tonight
but the secret is still my own
and my love for you is still unknown
alone
alone
till now i always got by on my own
i never really cared until i met you
and now it chills me to the bone
how do i get you alone
how do i get you alone
how do i get you alone
how do i get you alone
alone
alone
estoy llorando en mi habitación
todo se nubla a mi alrededor
y un jersey amarillo
por el parque los veo pasar
cuando se besan lo paso fatal
voy a llenarle el cuello
de polvos pica pica
sufre mamón
devuélveme a mi chica
o te retorcerás
entre polvos picapica
le quemamos su jersey
se ha comprado cinco o seis
lo tengo preparado
voy esta noche
no te reirás nunca mas de mi
lo siento nene vas a morir
y volverá conmigo
volverá algún día
we're walking in the air
we're floating in the moonlit sky
the people far below are sleeping as we fly
i'm holding very tight
i'm riding in the midnight blue
i'm finding i can fly so high above with you
far across the world
the villages go by like dreams
the rivers and the hills
the forests and the streams
children gaze openmouthed
taken by surprise
nobody down below believes their eyes
we're surfing in the air
we're swimming in the frozen sky
we're drifting over icy
mountains floating by
suddenly swooping low
on an ocean deep
rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep
we're walking in the air
we're dancing in the midnight sky
and everyone who sees us greets us as we fly
the power of love is a curious thing
make a one man weep make another man sing
change a hawk to a little white dove
more than a feeling that's the power of love
you don't need money don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
it's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
but it might just save your life
that's the power of love
that's the power of love
they say that all in love is fair
yeah but you don't care
but you know what to do
when it gets hold of you
and with a little help from above
you feel the power of love
you feel the power of love
can you feel it
hmmm
you won't feel nothin' till you feel
you feel the power just the power of love
that's the power that's the power of love
you feel the power of love
you feel the power of love
feel the power of love

i look through my window so bright
i see the stars come out tonight
i see the bright and hollow sky
over the cities ripping sky
and everything looks good tonight

the stars made for us tonight
oh the passenger
oh how you ride
oh the passenger
he rides and he rides
he looks through his window
and what does he see
he sees the bright and hollow sky
he sees the stars come out tonight
he sees the cities ripped back sides
he sees the winding ocean drive
and everything was made for you and me
all of it was made for you and me
and it just belongs to you and me
so lets take a ride and see what's mine
and singing la la laa la la la laa la la
a la laa lalaaaaa la la laa la la laa
la laa lalaaaaa la la laa la la laa

are you the passenger
he sees things from under glass
he looks through his window side
he sees the things he knows are his
he sees the bright and hollow sky
he sees the city sleeping at night
he sees the stars are out tonight
and all of it is yours and mine
and all of it is yours and mine
so lets all ride and ride and ride and ride
oh singing la la laa la la la laa la la

i'm trying to tell you something about my life
maybe give me insight between black and white
and the best thing you've ever done for me
is to help me take my life less seriously
it's only life after all
well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
and lightness has a call that's hard to hear
and i wrap my fear around me like a blanket
i sailed my ship of safety till i sank it
i'm crawling on your shores
i went to the doctor i went to the mountains
i looked to the children i drank from the fountains
there's more than one answer to these questions
pointing me in a crooked line
and the less i seek my source for some definitive
the closer i am to fine
the closer i am to fine
i went to see the doctor of philosophy
with a poster of rasputin and a beard down to his knee
he never did marry or see a bgrade movie
he graded my performance he said he could see through me
i spent four years prostrate to the higher mind got my paper
and i was free
i went to the doctor i went to the mountains
i looked to the children i drank from the fountains
there's more than one answer to these questions
pointing me in a crooked line
and the less i seek my source for some definitive
the closer i am to fine
the closer i am to fine
i stopped by the bar at am
to seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
i woke up with a headache like my head against a board
twice as cloudy as i'd been the night before
i went in seeking clarity
i went to the doctor i went to the mountains
i looked to the children i drank from the fountains
we go to the doctor we go to the mountains
we look to the children we drink from the fountains
we go to the bible we go through the workout
we read up on revival and we stand up for the lookout
there's more than one answer to these questions
pointing me in a crooked line
and the less i seek my source for some definitive
the closer i am to fine
the closer i am to fine
the closer i am to fine

don't ask me what you know is true
don't have to tell you i love your precious heart
i
i was standing
you were there
two worlds collided
and they could never tear us apart

we could live for a thousand years
but if i hurt you i'd make wine from your tears
i told you that we could fly
cause we all have wings but some of us don't know why
i
i was standing
you were there
two worlds collided
and they could never ever tear us apart
e|||
i
i was standing
you were there
two worlds collided
and they can never tear us apart
you
you were standing
i was there
two worlds collided
and they can never tear us apart
how sweet it is to be loved by you
how sweet it is to be loved by you
i needed the shelter of someone's arms
and there you were
i needed someone to understand my ups and downs
and there you were
with sweet love and devotion
deeply touching my emotion
i want to stop and thank you baby
i want to stop and thank you baby yes i do
how sweet it is to be loved by you
how sweet it is to be loved by you
i close my eyes at night
wondering where would i be without you in my life
everything i did was just a bore
everywhere i went it seems i'd been there before
but you brightened up for me all of my days
with a love so sweet in so many ways
i want to stop and thank you baby
i just want to stop and thank you baby
how sweet it is to be loved by you just like sugar sometimes
how sweet it is to be loved by you
you were better to me than i was to myself
for me there's you and there ain't nobody else
i want to stop and thank you baby
i just want to stop and thank you baby oh yes
how sweet it is to be loved by you
how sweet it is to be loved by you oh now
how sweet it is to be loved by you it's like jelly baby
how sweet it is to be loved by you just like honey to the bee baby
how sweet it is to be loved by you
how sweet it is to be loved by you

elle avait les yeux clairs et la robe en velours
a côté de sa mère et la famille autour
elle pose un peu distraite au doux soleil de la fin du jour
la photo n'est pas bonne mais l'on peut y voir
le bonheur en personne et la douceur d'un soir
elle aimait la musique surtout schumann et puis mozart
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi que je regarde tout bas
comme toi qui dors en rêvant à quoi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
elle allait à l'école au village d'en bas
elle apprenait les livres elle apprenait les lois
elle chantait les grenouilles et les princesses qui dorment au bois
elle aimait sa poupée elle aimait ses amis
surtout ruth et anna et surtout jérémy
et ils se marieraient un jour peutêtre à varsovie
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi que je regarde tout bas
comme toi qui dors en rêvant à quoi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
elle s'appelait sarah elle n'avait pas huit ans
sa vie c'était douceur rêves et nuages blancs
mais d'autres gens en avaient décidé autrement
elle avait tes yeux clairs et elle avait ton âge
c'était une petite fille sans histoire et très sage
mais elle n'est pas née comme toi ici et maintenant
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi que je regarde tout bas
comme toi qui dors en rêvant à quoi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi


i can give you a voice bred with rhythm and soul
the heart of a welsh boy who's lost his home
put it in harmony let the words ring
carry your thoughts in the songs we sing
je te donne mes notes je te donne mes mots
quand ta voix les emporte à ton propre tempo
une épaule fragile et solide à la fois
ce que j'imagine et ce que je crois
je te donne toutes mes différences
tous ces défauts qui sont autant de chances
on sera jamais des 'standards' des gens bien comme il faut
je te donne ce que j'ai ce que je vaux
i can give you the force
of my ancestral pride
the will to go on when i'm hurt deep inside
whatever the feeling whatever the way
it helps me go on from day to day
je te donne nos doutes et notre indicible espoir
les questions que les routes ont laissées dans l'histoire
nos filles sont brunes et l'on parle un peu fort
et l'humour et l'amour sont nos trésors
je te donne toutes mes différences
tous ces défauts qui sont autant de chances
on sera jamais des 'standards' des gens bien comme il faut
je te donne ce que j'ai ce que je vaux
je te donne donne donne ce que je suis
i can give you my voice bred with rhythm and soul
je te donne mes notes je te donne ma voix
the songs that i love and the stories i've told
ce que j'imagine et ce que je crois
i can make you feel good even when i'm down
les raisons qui me portent et ce stupide espoir
my force is a platform that you can climb on
une épaule fragile et forte à la fois
je te donne houuu je te donne
tout ce que je vaux ce que je suis mes dons mes défauts
mes plus belles chances mes différences
je te donne
puisque l'ombre gagne
puisqu'il n'est pas de montagne
audela des vents plus haute que les marches de l'oubli
puisqu'il faut apprendre
a defaut de le comprendre
a rever nos desirs et vivre des ainsi soitils
et puisque tu penses
comme une intime evidence
que parfois meme tout donner n'est pas forcement suffire
puisque c'est ailleurs
qu'ira mieux battre ton coeur
et puisque nous t'aimons trop pour te retenir
puisque tu pars
que les vents te menent ou d'autres ames plus belles
sauront t'aimer mieux que nous puisque l'on ne peut t'aimer plus
que la vie t'apprenne
mais que tu restes le meme
si tu te trahissais nous t'aurions tout a fait perdu
garde cette chance que nous t'envions en silence
cette force de penser que le plus beau reste a venir
et loin de nos villes
comme octobre l'est d'avril
sache qu'ici reste de toi comme une empreinte indelebile
sans drame sans larmes
pauvres et derisoires armes
parce qu'il est des douleurs qui ne pleurent qu'a l'interieur
puisque ta maison
aujourd'hui c'est l'horizon
dans ton exil essaie d'apprendre a revenir
mais pas trop tard
dans ton histoire
garde en memoire
notre au revoir
puisque tu pars
j'aurais pu fermer oublier toutes ces portes
tout quitter sur un simple geste mais tu ne l'as pas fait
j'aurais pu donner tant d'amour et tant de force
mais tout ce que je pouvais ça n'etait pas encore assez
pas assez pas assez pas assez

ni una simple sonrisa ni un poco de luz
en sus ojos profundos
ni siquiera reflejo de algún pensamiento
que alegre su mundo
hay tristeza en sus ojos hablando y callando
y bailando conmigo una pena lejana
que llega a mi alma y se hace cariño
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
vive solo y necesita amor
como el aire necesita verme
como al sol lo necesito yo
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
ha encontrado aquí una razón
para hacer que su mirada ría
con mis besos y mi gran amor
ni su nombre conozco y ya quiero volver
a encontrarlo a solas
y en sus ojos de otoño dormir poco a poco
olvidando las horas
yo pretendo saber por qué extraña razón
hoy sus ojos no ríen yo pretendo lograr
con ternura y amor ver sus ojos felices
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
vive solo y necesita amor
como el aire necesita verme
como al sol lo necesito yo
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
ha encontrado aquí una razón
para hacer que su mirada ría
con mis besos y mi gran amor
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
vive solo y necesita amor
como el aire necesita verme
como al sol lo necesito yo

oh those small communities
all my friends are so small town
my parents live in the same small town
my job is so small town
provides little opportunity
educated in a small town

used to daydream in that small town
another boring romantic that's me
but i've seen it all in a small town
had myself a ball in a small town
married an la doll and brought her to this small town

no i cannot forget where it is that i come from
i cannot forget the people who love me
yeah i can be myself here in this small town

oh and that's good enough for me
well i was born in a small town
and i can breathe in a small town
gonna die in this small town
and that's probl'y where they'll bury me
intro
you come home late and you come home early
you come on big when you're feeling small
you come home straight and you come home curly
sometimes you don't come home at all
so what in the world's come over you
and what in heaven's name have you done
you've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
you're out there running just to be on the run
well i got a heart that burns with a fever
and i got a worried and a jealous mind
how can a love that'll last forever
get left so far behind
so what in the world's come over you
and what in heaven's name have you done
you've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
you're out there running just to be on the run
it's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
it's crossed the evil line today
how can you ask about tomorrow
we ain't got one word to say
so what in the world's come over you
and what in heaven's name have you done
you've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
you're out there running just to be on the run
you're out there running just to be on the run
you're out there running just to be on the run


just a small town girl living in a lonely world
she took the midnight train going anywhere
just a city boy born and raised in south detroit
he took the midnight train going anywhere
a singer in a smoky room a smell of wine and cheap perfume
for a smile they can share the night it goes on and on and on and on
strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlight people living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night
working hard to get my fill everybody wants a thrill
paying anything to roll the dice just one more time
some will win some will lose some were born to sing the blues
oh the movie never ends it goes on and on and on and on
strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlight people living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night
don't stop believing hold on to the feeling
streetlight people
don't stop believing hold on to the feeling
streetlight people
don't stop believing hold on to the feeling
streetlight people
highway run into the midnight sun
wheels go round and round you're on my mind
restless hearts sleep alone tonight
sending all my love along the wire
they say that the road ain't no place to start a family
right down the line it's been you and me
and lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
oh oh girl you stand by me
i'm forever yours faithfully
circus life under the big top world
we all need the clowns to make us smile
through space and time always another show
wondering where i am lost without you
and being apart ain't easy on this love affair
two strangers learn to fall in love again
i get the joy of rediscovering you
oh oh girl you stand by me
i'm forever yours faithfully
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
faithfully i'm still yours
faithfully i'm forever yours
faithfully oh oh oh oh oh oh
e||
lying beside you here in the dark feeling your heartbeat with mine
softly you whisper you're so sincere how could our love be so blind
we sailed on together we drifted apart and here you are by my side
so now i come to you with open arms nothing to hide believe what i say
so here i am with open arms hoping you'll see what your love means
to me open arms
living without you living alone this empty house seems so cold
wanting to hold you wanting you near how much i wanted you home
but now that you've come back turned night into day i need you to say
so now i come to you with open arms nothing to hide believe what i say
so here i am with open arms hoping you'll see what your love means
to me open arms
here we stand
worlds apart hearts broken in two two two
sleepless nights
losing ground
i'm reaching for you you you
feelin' that it's gone
can change your mind
if we can't go on
to survive the tide love divides
someday love will find you
break those chains that bind you
one night will remind you
how we touched
and went our separate ways
if he ever hurts you
true love won't desert you
you know i still love you
though we touched
and went our separate ways
troubled times
caught between confusions and pain pain pain
distant eyes
promises we made were in vain vain vain
if you must go i wish you love
you'll never walk alone
take care my love
miss you love
someday love will find you
break those chains that bind you
one night will remind you
how we touched
and went our separate ways
if he ever hurts you
true love won't desert you
you know i still love you
though we touched
and went our separate ways
someday love will find you
break those chains that bind you
one night will remind you
if he ever hurts you
true love won't desert you
you know i still love you
i still love you girl
i really love you girl
and if he ever hurts you
true love won't desert you
nooooooooooooo
nooooooooooooo
when routine bites hard
and ambitions are low
and resentment rides high
but emotions won't grow
and we're changing our ways
taking different roads
then love love will tear us apart again
love love will tear us apart again
why is the bedroom so cold
turned away on your side
is my timing that flawed
our respect run so dry
yet there's still this appeal
that we've kept through our lives
and love love will tear us apart again
love love will tear us apart again
do you cry out in your sleep
all my failings exposed
get a taste in my mouth
as desperation takes hold
is it something so good
just can't function no more
when love love will tear us apart again
love love will tear us apart again
love love will tear us apart again
love love will tear us apart again

there'll be no strings to bind your hands
not if my love can't bind your heart
there's no need to take a stand
for it was i who chose to start
i see no need to take me home
i'm old enough to face the dawn
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me baby
just call me angel of the morning angel
then slowly turn away from me
maybe the sun's light will be dim
and it won't matter anyhow
if morning's echo says we we sinned
well it was what i wanted now
and if we're the victims of the night
i won't be blinded by light
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me baby
just call me angel of the morning angel
then slowly turn away
i won't beg you to stay
with me
through the tears
of the day
of the years baaaby
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me baby
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me darlin'
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me darrlin'
on pohjantähden alla tää koti mulla mainen
mä elämästä laulan olen suomalainen
oi jospa tietäisivät maailmalla
aikaan saisi aika monta valtamerta
on täällä monta yksinäistä
eikä ikävoivät lemmenlaulut
on täällä elämä raskasta työtä
ja siinä harvemmin on onni myötä
sen tietää vain yksin suomalainen
on pohjantähden alla tää koti mulla mainen
mä elämästä laulan sillä oonhan suomalainen
mä rakkaudesta laulan on siinä mies ja nainen
pohjantähden alla elää suomalainen
on tässä maassa itsepäinen kansa
kuin yksin kuolema ja virkavalta vain
me käymme vastamäkeen sielu surren
ettei kannattanutkaan
on täällä elämä raskasta työtä
ja siinä harvemmin on onni myötä
sen tietää vain yksin suomalainen
on pohjantähden alla tää koti mulla mainen
mä elämästä laulan sillä oonhan suomalainen
mä rakkaudesta laulan on siinä mies ja nainen
pohjantähden alla elää suomalainen

she wanted to test her husband
she knew exactly what to do
a pseudonym to fool him
she couldn't have made a worse move
she sent him scented letters
and he received them with a strange delight
just like his wife
but how she was before the tears
and how she was before the years flew by
and how she was when she was beautiful
she signed the letter
all yours
babooshka babooshka babooshka ya ya
all yours
babooshka babooshka babooshka ya ya
babooshka
she wanted to take it further
so she arranged a place to go
to see if he
would falluh for her incognito
and when he laid eyes on her
he got the feeling they had met before
uncanny how she
reminds him of his little lady
capacity to give him all he needs
just like his wife before she freezed on him
just like his wife when she was beautiful
he shouted out
i'm all yours
babooshka babooshka babooshka ya ya
all yours
babooshka babooshka babooshka ya ya
all yours

a touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever i fall
now you say it best when you say nothing at all
all day long i can hear people talking out loud
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
old mister webster could never define
what's being said between your heart and mine
the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
a touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever i fall
now you say it best when you say nothing at all

lag ja galeke fir yeh haseen raat ho na ho
shayad fir is janam main mulakat ho na ho
lag ja galefir
humko mili hain aaj yeh ghadiyan naseeb se
ji bhar ke dekh lijiye humko kareeb se
fir aapke naseeb main yeh baat ho na ho
shayad fir is janam main mulakat ho na ho
lag ja galefir
paas aaiye ke hum nahin aayenge baar baar
baahein gale mein daal ke hum ro lein zaar zaar
aankhon se phir yeh pyaar ki barsaat ho na ho
shaayad phir is janam mein mulaqaat ho na ho
oh the night is my world
city light painted girl
in the day nothing matters
it's the night time that flatters
in the night no control
through the wall something's breaking
wearing white as you're walkin'
down the street of my soul
you take my self you take my self control
you got me livin' only for the night
before the morning comes the story's told
you take my self you take my self control
another night another day goes by
i never stop myself to wonder why
you help me to forget to play my role
you take my self you take my self control
i i live among the creatures of the night
i haven't got the will to try and fight
against a new tomorrow so i guess i'll just believe it
that tomorrow never comes
a safe night i'm living in the forest of my dream
i know the night is not as it would seem
i must believe in something so i'll make myself believe it
that this night will never go
ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh
ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh
oh the night is my world
city light painted girl
in the day nothing matters

in tempo em
dance me to your beauty
with a burning violin
dance me through the panic
till i'm gathered safely in
lift me like an olive branch
and be my homeward dove
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love
let me see your beauty
when the witnesses are gone
let me feel you moving
like they do in babylon
show me slowly what i only
know the limits of
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the wedding now
dance me on and on
dance me very tenderly and
dance me very long
we're both of us beneath our love
we're both of us above
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the children
who are asking to be born
dance me through the curtains
that our kisses have outworn
raise a tent of shelter now
though every thread is torn
dance me to the end of love
dance me to your beauty
with a burning violin
dance me through the panic
till i'm gathered safely in
touch me with your naked hand
touch me with your glove
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the end of love
everybody knows that the dice are loaded
everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
everybody knows the war is over
everybody knows that the good guys lost
everybody knows the fight was fixed
the poor stay poor the rich get rich
that's how it goes everybody knows
everybody knows that the boat is leaking
everybody knows that the captain lied
everybody got this broken feeling
like their father or their dog just died
everybody talking to their pockets
everybody wants a box of chocolates
and a long stem rose everybody knows
everybody knows that you love me baby
everybody knows that you really do
everybody knows that you've been faithful
give or take a night or two
everybody knows you've been discreet
but there were so many people you just had to meet
without your clothes and everybody knows
everybody knows everybody knows
that's how things goes everybody knows
everybody knows everybody knows
that's how things goes everybody knows
and everybody knows that it's now or never
everybody knows that it's me or you
and everybody knows that you live forever
when you've done a line or two
everybody knows the deal is rotten
old black joe's still picking cotton
for your ribbon and bows and everybody knows
everybody knows the plague is coming
everybody knows that it's moving fast
everybody knows that your naked man and woman
are just a shining artifact of the past
everybody knows the scene is dead
but there's gonna be a meter on your bed
which will disclose what everybody knows
and everybody knows that you're in trouble
everybody knows what you've been through
from the bloody cross on top of calvary
to the beach of malibu
everybody knows it's coming apart
take one last look at this sacred heart
before it blows and everybody knows
everybody knows everybody knows
that's how it goes everybody knows
everybody knows everybody knows
that's how it goes everybody knows
everybody knows everybody knows
that's how it goes everybody knows
now i've heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music do you
it goes like this the fourth the fifth
the minor fall the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleluujah
your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
she tied you to a kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleluujah
you say i took the name in vain
i don't even know the name
but if i did well really what's it to ya
there's a blaze of light in every word
it doesn't matter which you heard
the holy or the broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleluujah
i did my best it wasn't much
i couldn't feel so i tried to touch
i've told the truth i didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
i'll stand before the lord of song
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
if you want a lover i'll do anything you ask me to
and if you want another kind of love i'll wear a mask for you
if you want a partner take my hand or if you want to strike me down in anger
here i stand i'm your man
if you want a boxer i will step into the ring for you
and if you want a doctor i'll examine every inch of you
if you want a driver climb inside or if you want a take me for a ride
you know you can i'm your man
ah the moon's too bright the chain's too tight the beast won't go to sleep
i've been running through these promises to you that i made and i could not keep
ah but a man never got a women back not by begging on his knees
or i'd crawl to you baby and i'd fall at your feet
and i'd howl at your beauty like a dog in heat
and i'd claw at your heart and i'd tear at your sheet i'd say please
please i'm your man
and if you've got to sleep for a moment on the road i will steer for you
and if you want to walk the street alone i'll disappear for you
if you want a father for your child or only want to walk with me
awhile across the sand i'm your man

on raglan road of an autumn day
i saw her first and i knew
that her dark hair would weave a snare
that i might one day rue
i saw the danger and i passed
along the enchanted way
and i said "let grief be a falling leaf
at the dawning of the day"
on grafton street in november
we tripped lightly along the ledge
of a deep ravine where can be seen
the worth of passion's pledge
the queen of hearts still making tarts
and i not making hay
oh i loved too much and by such
by such is happiness thrown away
i gave her gifts of the mind
i gave her the secret sign
that's known to the artists who have known
the true gods of sound and stone
and word and tint without stint
i gave her poems to say
with her own name there and her long dark hair
like clouds over fields of may
on a quiet street where old ghosts meet
i see her walking now
away from me so hurriedly
my reason must allow
that i have loved not as i should
a creature made of clay
when the angel woes the clay he'll lose
his wings at the dawn of day
como puede ser verdad
last night i dreamt of san pedro
just like i'd never gone i knew the song
a young girl with eyes like the desert
it all seems like yesterday not far away
tropical the island breeze
all of nature wild and free
this is where i long to be
la isla bonita
and when the samba played
the sun would set so high
ring through my ears and sting my eyes
your spanish lullaby
i fell in love with san pedro
warm wind carried on the sea he called to me
te dijo te amo
i prayed that the days would last they went so fast
tropical the island breeze
all of nature wild and free
this is where i long to be
la isla bonita
and when the samba played
the sun would set so high
ring through my ears and sting my eyes
your spanish lullaby
i want to be where the sun warms the sky
when it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
beautiful faces no cares in this world
where a girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl
last night i dreamt of san pedro
it all seems like yesterday not far away
tropical the island breeze
all of nature wild and free
this is where i long to be
la isla bonita
and when the samba played
the sun would set so high
ring through my ears and sting my eyes
your spanish lullaby
tropical the island breeze
all of nature wild and free
this is where i long to be
la isla bonita
and when the samba played
the sun would set so high
ring through my ears and sting my eyes
your spanish lullaby
life is a mystery
everyone must stand a lone
i hear you call my name
and it feels like home
when you call my name
it's like a little prayer
i'm down on my knees
i wanna take you there
in the midnight hour
i can feel your power
just like a prayer
you know i'll take you there
i hear your voice
it's like an angel sighing
i have no choice i hear your voice
feels like flying
i close my eyes
oh god i think i'm falling
out of the sky i close my eyes
heaven help me
when you call my name
it's like a little prayer
i'm down on my knees
i wanna take you there
in the midnight hour
i can feel your power
just like a prayer
you know i'll take you there
like a child
you whisper softly to me
you're in control just like a child
now i'm dancing
it's like a dream
no end and no beginning
you're here with me it's like a dream
let the choir sing
when you call my name
it's like a little prayer
i'm down on my knees
i wanna take you there
in the midnight hour
i can feel your power
just like a prayer
you know i'll take you there
life is a mystery
everyone must stand alone
i hear you call my name
and it feels like home
just like a prayer your voice can take me there
just like amuse to me you are a mystery
just like a dream you are not what you seem
just like a prayer no choice your voice can take me there
just like a prayer i’ll take you there | repeat
it’s like a dream to me |
just like a prayer your voice can take me there
just like amuse to me you are a mystery
just like a dream you are not what you seem
just like a prayer no choice your voice can take me there
just like a prayer i’ll take you there
it’s like a dream to me
un peu spéciale elle est célibataire
le visage pâle les cheveux en arrière
et j'aime ça
elle se dessine sous des jupes fendues
et je devine des histoires défendues
c'est comme ça
tell'ment si belle quand elle sort
tell'ment si belle je l'aime tell'ment si fort
elle a les yeux revolver elle a le regard qui tue
elle a tiré la première m'a touché c'est foutu
elle a les yeux revolver elle a le regard qui tue
elle a tiré la première elle m'a touché c'est foutu
un peu larguée un peu seule sur la terre
les mains tendues les cheveux en arrière
et j'aime ça
a faire l'amour sur des malentendus
on vit toujours des moments défendus
c'est comme ça
tell'ment si femme quand elle mord
tell'ment si femme je l'aime tell'ment si fort
elle a les yeux revolver elle a le regard qui tue
elle a tiré la première m'a touché c'est foutu
elle a les yeux revolver elle a le regard qui tue
elle a tiré la première m'a touché c'est foutu
son corps s'achève sous des draps inconnus
et moi je rêve de gestes défendus
c'est comme ça
un peu spéciale elle est célibataire
le visage pâle les cheveux en arrière
et j'aime ça
tell'ment si femme quand elle dort
tell'ment si belle je l'aime tell'ment si fort
elle a les yeux revolver elle a le regard qui tue
elle a tiré la première m'a touché c'est foutu
elle a les yeux revolver elle a le regard qui tue
elle a tiré la première elle m'a touché c'est foutu
tonto el que no entienda
cuenta una leyenda
que una hembra gitana
conjuró a la luna
hasta el amanecer
llorando pedía
al llegar el día
desposar un ca interlude lé
tendrás a tu hombre piel morena
desde el cielo habló la luna llena
pero a cambio quiero
el hijo primero
que le engendres a él
que quien su hijo inmola
para no estar sola
poco le iba a querer
luna quieres ser ma dre
y no encuentras querer
que te haga mujer
dime luna de pla ta
que pretendes hacer
con un nińo de piel
ahahahah
ahahahah
hijo de la lu interlude na
de padre canela nació un nińo
blanco como el lomo de un armińo
con los ojos grises
en vez de aceituna
nińo albino de luna
maldita su estampa
este hijo es un payo
y yo no me lo callo
luna quieres ser ma dre
y no encuentras querer
que te haga mujer
dime luna de pla ta
que pretendes hacer
con un nińo de piel
ahahahah
ahahahah
hijo de la lu interlude na
gitano al creerse deshonrado
se fue a su mujer cuchillo en mano
de quién es el hijo
me has engańó fijo
y de muerte a hirió
luego se hizo al monte
con el nińo en brazos
y allí le abandonó
luna quieres ser ma dre
y no encuentras querer
que te haga mujer
dime luna de pla ta
que pretendes hacer
con un nińo de piel
ahahahah
ahahahah
hijo de la lu interlude na
y en las noches que haga luna llena
será porque el nińo esté de buenas
y si el nińo llora
menguará la luna
para hacerle una cuna
y si el nińo llora
menguará la luna
para hacerle una cuna
travelling in a friedout kombi
on a hippy trail head full of zombie
i met a strange lady she made me nervous
she took me in and gave me breakfast and she said
do you come from a land down under
where women glow and men plunder
can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
you better run you better take cover
buying bread from a man in brussels he was
six foot four and full of muscles
i said do you speaka my language
he just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich and he said
i come from a land down under
where beer does flow and men chunder
can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
you better run you better take cover yeeah
lying in a den in bombay
with a slack jaw and not much to say
i said to the man are you trying to tempt me
because i come from the land of plenty and he said
do you come from a land down under yeeyah
where women glow and men plunder
can't you hear can't you hear the thunder yeeah
you better run you better take cover we are
living in a land down under
where women glow and men plunder
can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
you better run you better take cover
living in a land down under
where women glow and men plunder
can't you hear can't you hear the thunder ooh yeah
you better run you better take cover we are
living in a land down under
where women glow and men plunder
can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
you better run you better take cover fade
i can't get to sleep
i think about the implications
of diving in too deep
and possibly the complications
especially at night
i worry over situations
i know will be alright
perhaps its just my imagination
day after day it reappears
night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
ghost appear and fade away
alone between the sheets
only brings exasperation
it's time to walk the streets
smell the desperation
at least there's pretty lights
and though there's little variation
it nullifies the night
from overkill
day after day it reappears
night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
ghost appear and fade away
come back another day
i can't get to sleep
i think about the implications
of diving in too deep
and possibly the complications
especially at night
i worry over situations now
i know will be alright
it's just overkill
day after day it reappears
night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
ghost appear and fade away
ghost appear and fade away
ghost appear and fade away
who can this be knocking at my door go away don't come round here no more
can't you see that its late at night i'm very tired and i'm not feeling right
all i wish was to be alone stay away don't you invade my home
best off if you hang outside don't come in i'll only run and hide
who can it be now who can it be now who can it be now who can it be now
who can it be knocking at my door make no sound tiptoe across the floor
if he hears he'll knock all day i'll be trapped and here i'll have to stay
i've done no harm i keep to myself there's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
i like it here with my childhood friend here they come those feelings again
who can it be now who can it be now who can it be now who can it be now
is this the man come to take me away why do they follow me
it's not the future that i can see it's just my fantasy
who can it be now who can it be now who can it be now who can it be now
who can it be now who can it be now who can it be now who can it be now
e|||||
life it seems will fade away drifting further every day
getting lost within myself nothing matters no one else
i have lost the will to live simply nothing more to give
there is nothing more for me need the end to set
things not what they used to be missing one inside of me
deathly lost this can't be real cannot stand this hell i feel
emptiness is filling me to the point of agony
growing darkness taking dawn i was me but now
e||
e||
no one but me can save myself but it's too late
now i can't think think why i should even try
yesterday seems as though it never existed
death greats me warm now i will just say goodbye
e||

just chords
make his fight on the hill in the early day
constant chill deep inside
shouting gun on they run through the endless grey
on they fight for they're right yes but who's to say
for a hill men would kill why they do not know
stiffened wounds test their pride
men of five still alive through the raging glow
gone insane from the pain that they surely know
for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls
take a look to the sky just before you die
it is the last time you will
blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
he hears the silence so loud
crack of dawn all is gone except the will to be
now they see what will be blinded eyes to see
for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls
end of passion play crumbling away
taste me you will see
how i'm killing you
come crawling faster
obey your master
your life burns faster
obey your master
master
master of puppets i'm pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
blinded by me you can't see a thing
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
master
master
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
master
master
needlework the way never you betray
taste me you will see
how i'm killing you
come crawling faster
obey your master
your life burns faster
obey your master
master
master of puppets i'm pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
blinded by me you can't see a thing
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
master
master
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
master
master
master master
where's the dreams that i've been after
master master
you promised only lies
laughter laughter
all i hear and see is laughter
laughter laughter
laughing at my cries
hell is worth all that natural habitat
i will occupy
come crawling faster
obey your master
your life burns faster
obey your master
master
master of puppets i'm pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
blinded by me you can't see a thing
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
master
master
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
master
master
i can't remember anything
can't tell if this is true or dream
deep down inside i feel to scream
this terrible silence stops me
now that the war is through with me
i'm waking up i cannot see
that there is not much left of me
nothing is real but pain now
hold my breath as i wish for death
oh please god wake me
back in the womb it's much too real
in pumps life that i must feel
but can't look forward to reveal
look to the time when i'll live
fed through the tube that sticks in me
just like a wartime novelty
tied to machines that make me be
cut this life off from me
hold my breath as i wish for death
oh please god wake me
now the world is gone i'm just one
oh god help me
hold my breath as i wish for death
oh please god help me
darkness imprisoning me
absolute horror
i cannot live
body my holding cell
landmine has taken my sight
taken my hearing
taken my arms
left me with life in hell
i could hardly believe it
when i heard the news today
i had to come and get it straight from you
they said you where leaving
someone sweapt you heart away
from that look on your face i say it's true
so tell me all about it tell me about the plans your making
tell me one thing more before i go
tell me how am i supposed to live without you
now that i've been loving you so long
how am i supposed to live without you
and how am i supposed to carry on
when all that i've been living for is gone
too tired for crying didn't come her to break down
it's just a dream of mine that's coming to an end
and how can i play now when i build my world around
the hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends
i don't wanna know the price i'm gonna pay for dreaming
even now it's more than i can take
tell me how am i supposed to live without you
now that i've been loving you so long
how am i supposed to live without you
and how am i supposed to carry on
when all that i've been living for is gone
tell me how am i supposed to live without you
now that i've been loving you so long
how am i supposed to live without you
and how am i supposed to carry on
when all that i've been living for is gone

she was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
i said don't mind but what do you mean i am the one
who will dance on the floor in the round
she said i am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
she told me her name was billie jean as she caused a scene
then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
who will dance on the floor in the round
people always told me be careful what you do
and don't go around breaking young girl's hearts
and mother always told me be careful of who you love
and be careful of what you do 'cos the lie becomes the truth
billie jean is not my lover
she's just a girl who claims that i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son
for forty days and forty nights the law was on her side
but who can stand when she's in demand her schemes and plans
'cos we danced on the floor in the round
so take my strong advice just remember to always think twice
do think twice
she told my baby we'd danced 'till three then she looked a me
then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes looked like mine
go on dance on the floor in the round baby
people always told me be careful what you do
and don't go around breaking young girl's hearts
she came and stood right by me then the smell of sweet perfume
this happened much too soon she called me to her room
billie jean is not my lover
she's just a girl who claims that i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son
billie jean is not my lover
she's just a girl who claims that i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one
but the kid is not my son
billie jean is not my lover
billie jean is not my lover
billie jean is not my lover

looking out across the nighttime
the city winks a sleepless eye
hear her voice shake my window
sweet seducing sighs
get me out into the nighttime
four walls won't hold me tonight
if this town is just an apple
then let me take a bite if they say
why why tell them that its human nature
why why does he do me that way if they say
why why tell them that its human nature
why why does he do me that way
reaching out to touch a stranger

why why does he do me that way if they say
why why tell them that its human nature
why why does he do me that way

as i turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat this wind is blowin' my mind
i see the kids in the street with not enough to eat

there are some with no home not a nickel to loan

and a washedout dream
they follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'cause they got no place to be

i'm starting with the man in the mirror
i'm asking him to change his ways
and no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place
take a look at yourself and then make a change
i'm starting with the man in the mirror
i'm asking him to change his ways
and no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place

i'm asking him to change his ways
no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place
take a look at yourself and then make the change

'cause when you close your heart

darkness falls across the land the midnight hour is close at hand
creatures crawl in search of blood to terrorise your neighbourhood
and whosoever shall be found without the soul for getting down
must stand and face the hounds of hell and rot inside a corpse's shell
the foulest stench is in the air the funk of forty thousand years
and grizzy ghouls from every tomb are closing in to seal your doom
and though you fight to stay alive your body starts to shiver
for no mere mortal can resist the evil of the thriller
two old friends meet again
wearin older faces
and talk about the places they have been
two old sweethearts who fell apart
somewhere long ago how were they to know
that someday they'd meet again
and have a need for more than reminiscing
maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find
maybe now they can be more than just friends
she's back in his life and it feels so right
maybe this time love won't end
it’s the same old feeling back again
it`s the one that they had back when
they were too young to know when love is real
but somehow something never change
and even time hasn`t cooled the flame
it`s even burning brighter than they did before
it got another chance and if they take it
maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find
maybe now they can be more than just friends
she's back in his life and it feels so right
maybe this time love won't end
she`s smiling like she use to smile way back then
he`s feelin like he used to feel way back when they
tried but something kept them waiting for this
magic moment
maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find
maybe now they can be more than just friends
she's back in his life and it feels so right
maybe this time
may be this time
maybe this time
love won`t end…




just a steel town girl on a saturday night
looking for the fight of her life
in the real time world no one sees her at all
it can cut you like a knife if the fight becomes the fire
on the wire between will and what will be
she's a maniac maniac on the floor
and she's dancing like she's never danced before
she's a maniac maniac on the floor
and she's dancing like she's never danced before
out where the river broke the bloodwood and the desert oak
the time has come to say fair's fair
to pay the rent to pay our share
the time has come a fact's a fact
it belongs to them let's give it back
how can we dance when our earth is turning
how do we sleep while our beds are burning
how can we dance when our earth is turning
how do we sleep while our beds are burning
the time has come to say fairs fair
to pay the rent now to pay our share
four wheels scare the cockatoos from kintore east to yuendemu
the time has come to say fair's fair
to pay the rent to pay our share
the time has come a fact's a fact
it belongs to them let's give it back
how can we dance when our earth is turning
how do we sleep while our beds are burning
how can we dance when our earth is turning
how do we sleep while our beds are burning
the time has come to say fair's fair
to pay the rent to pay our share
the time has come a fact's a fact
it belongs to them let's give it back
how can we dance when our earth is turning
how do we sleep while our beds are burning

the last that ever she saw him
carried away by a moonlight shadow
he passed on worried and warning
carried away by a moonlight shadow
lost in a riddle that saturday night
far away on the other side
he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
and she couldn't find how to push through
the trees that whisper in the evening
carried away by a moonlight shadow
sing a song of sorrow and grieving
carried away by a moonlight shadow
all she saw was a silhouette of a gun
far away on the other side
he was shot six times by a man on the run
and she couldn't find how to push through
i stay i pray
see you in heaven far away
i stay i pray
see you in heaven one day
four am in the morning
carried away by a moonlight shadow
i watched your vision forming
carried away by a moonlight shadow
star was light in a silvery night
far away on the other side
will you come to talk to me this night
but she couldn't find how to push through
i stay i pray
see you in heaven far away
i stay i pray
see you in heaven one day
far away on the other side
caught in the middle of a hundred and five
the night was heavy and the air was alive
but she couldn't find how to push through
carried away by a moonlight shadow
carried away by a moonlight shadow
far away on the other side

moving forward using all my breath
making love to you was never second best
i saw the world crashing all around your face
never really knowing it was always mesh and lace
i’ll stop the world and melt with you
you’ve seen the difference and it’s getting better all the time
there’s nothing you and i won’t do
i’ll stop the world and melt with you
dream of better lives the kind which never hate
trapped in the state of imaginary grace
i made a pilgrimage to save this humans race
never comprehending the race had long gone by
i’ll stop the world and melt with you
you’ve seen the difference and it’s getting better all the time
there’s nothing you and i won’t do
i’ll stop the world and melt with you
i’ll stop the world and melt with you
you’ve seen some changes and it’s getting better all the time
there’s nothing you and i won’t do
i’ll stop the world and melt with you
hmmm hmmm hmmm
hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm
hmmm hmmm hmmm
hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm
i’ll stop the world and melt with you
you’ve seen the difference and it’s getting better all the time
there’s nothing you and i won’t do
i’ll stop the world and melt with you
i’ll stop the world and melt with you
i’ll stop the world and melt with you

trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
armageddon come armageddon
come armageddon come
every day is like sunday
every day is silent and grey
hide on the promenade etch on a postcard
how i dearly wish i was not here
in this seaside town
that they forgot to bomb
come comecome nuclear bomb
every day is like sunday
every day is silent and grey
trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
and on your face
on your face
on your face
on your face
every day is like sunday
win yourself a cheap tray
share some greased tea with me
every day is silent and grey
repeat and fade

lucha de gigantes
convierte el aire en gas natural
un duelo salvaje advierte
lo cerca que ando de entrar
en un mundo descomunal
siento mi fragilidad
vaya pesadilla
corriendo con una bestia detras
dime que es mentira todo
un sueño tonto y no más
me da miedo la enormidad
donde nadie oye mi voz
deja de engañar no quieras ocultar
que has pasado sin tropezar
monstruo de papel no se contra quien voy
es que acaso hay alguien más aqui
creo en los fantasmas terribles
de algun extraño lugar
y en mis tonterias para hacer tu risa estallar
en un mundo descomunal
siento tu fragilidad
deja de engañar no quieras ocultar
que has pasado sin tropezar
monstruo de papel no se contra quien voy
o es que acaso hay alguien más aqui
deja que pasemos sin miedo

hast du etwas zeit für mich dann singe ich ein lied für dich
von luftballons auf ihrem weg zum horizont
denkst du vielleicht grad' an mich dann singe ich ein lied für dich
von luftballons und dass sowas von sowas kommt
luftballons auf ihrem weg zum horizont hielt man für ufos aus dem all
darum schickte ein general eine fliegerstaffel hinterher
alarm zu geben wenn's so wär' dabei war da am horizont nur luftballons
düsenflieger jeder war ein grosser krieger
hielten sich für captain kirk das gab ein grosses feuerwerk
die nachbarn haben nichts gerafft und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
dabei schoss man am horizont auf luftballons
kriegsminister streichholz und benzinkanister
hielten sich für schlaue leute witterten schon fette beute
riefen krieg und wollten macht mann wer hätte das gedacht
dass es einmal soweit kommt wegen luftballons
wegen luftballons
luftballons
jahre krieg ließen keinen platz für sieger
kriegsminister gibts nicht mehr und auch keine düsenflieger
heute zieh ich meine runden seh die welt in trümmern liegen
hab' nen luftballon gefunden denk' an dich und lass' ihn fliegen
im sturz durch raum und zeit richtung unendlichkeit
fliegen motten in das licht genau wie du und ich
irgendwie fängt irgendwann irgendwo die zukunft an
ich warte nicht mehr lang liebe wird aus mut gemacht
denk nicht lange nach wir fahr'n auf feuerrädern
richtung zukunft durch die nacht
gib mir die hand ich bau' dir ein schloß aus sand
irgendwie irgendwo irgendwann
die zeit ist reif für ein bißchen zärtlichkeit
irgendwie irgendwo irgendwann
im sturz durch zeit und raum erwacht aus einem traum
nur ein kurzer augenblick dann kehrt die nacht zurück
irgendwie fäng irgendwann irgendwo die zukunft an
ich warte nicht mehr lang liebe wird aus mut gemacht
denk nicht lange nach wir fahr'n auf feuerrädern
richtung zukunft durch die nacht
gib mir die hand ich bau dir ein schloß aus sand
irgendwie irgendwo irgendwann
die zeit ist reif für ein bißchen zärtlichkeit
irgendwie irgendwo irgendwann
i got it bad you don't know how bad i got it
you got it easy you don't know when you got it good
it's getting harder just keeping life and soul together
i'm sick of fighting even though i know i shouldn't
the cold is biting thru each and every nerve and fibre
my broken spirit is frozen to the core
i don't wanna be here no more
wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
even if it was for just one day
and wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away
wouldn't it be good to be on your side
the grass is always greener over there
wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care
you must be joking you don't know a thing about it
you've got no problem i'd stay right there if it were you
i got it harder you couldn't dream how hard it got it
stay out of my shoes if you know what's good for you
the heat is stifling burning me up from me inside
the sweat is coming thru each and every pore
i don't wanna be here no more
wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
even if it was for just one day
and wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away
wouldn't it be good to be on your side
the grass is always greener over there
wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care
crazy but that's how it goes millions of people living as foes
maybe it's not to late to learn how to love and forget how to hate
mental wounds not healing life's a bitter shame
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i've listened to preachers i've listened to fools
i've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules
one person conditioned to rule and control
the media sells it and you live the role
mental wounds still screaming driving me insane
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i know that things are going wrong for me
you gotta listen to my words yehh
heirs of a cold war that's what we've become
inheriting troubles i'm mentally numb
crazy i just cannot bear
i'm living with something that just isn't fair
mental wounds not healing who and what's to blame
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train

we belong we belong to the light
many times ive tried to tell you
many times ive cried alone
always im surprised how well you
cut my feelings to the bone
dont want to leave you really
ive invested too much time
to give you up that easy
to the doubts that complicate your mind
we belong to the light
we belong to the thunder
we belong to the sound of the words
weve both fallen under
whatever we deny or embrace
for worse or for better
we belong we belong
we belong together
maybe its a sign of weakness
when i dont know what to say
maybe i just wouldnt know
what to do with my strength anyway
have we become a habit
do we distort the facts
now theres no looking forward
now theres no turning back
when you say
we belong to the light
we belong to the thunder
we belong to the sound of the words
weve both fallen under
whatever we deny or embrace
for worse or for better
we belong we belong
we belong together
close your eyes and try to sleep now
close your eyes and try to dream
clear your mind and do your best
to try and wash the palette clean
we cant begin to know it
how much we really care
i hear your voice inside me
i see your face everywhere
still you say
we belong to the light
we belong to the thunder
we belong to the sound of the words
weve both fallen under
whatever we deny or embrace
for worse or for better
we belong we belong
we belong together
we belong to the light
we belong to the thunder
we belong to the sound of the words
weve both fallen under
whatever we deny or embrace
for worse or for better
we belong we belong
we belong together
she's like the wind through my tree she rides the night next to me
she leads me through moonlight only to burn me with the sun
she's taking my heart but she doesn't know what she's done
feel her breath in my face her body close to me
can't look in her eyes she's out of my league
just a fool to believe i have anything she needs she's like the wind
i look in the mirror and all i see is a young old man with only a dream
am i just fooling myself that she'll stop the pain
living without her i'll go insane
feel her breath in my face her body close to me
can't look in her eyes she's out of my league
just a fool to believe i have anything she needs she's like the wind
feel your breath in my face your body close to me
can't look in your eyes you're out of my league
just a fool to believe just a fool to believe she´s like a wind
i was waltzing with my darlin' to the tennessee waltz
when an old friend i happened to see
i introduced her to my loved one

in the middle in the middle
in the middle of a dream

i see the knives out i turn my back
i hear the train coming i stay right on that track
in the middle in the middle
in the middle of a dream

they got married early never had no money
then when he got laid off they really hit the skids
he started up his drinking then they started fighting
he took it pretty badly she took both the kids
she said "i'm not standing by to watch you slowly die
so watch me walking out the door
out the door out the door
she said "shove it jack i'm walking out your fucking door"
she went to her brother's got a little bar work
he went to the buttery he stayed about a year
then he wrote a letter he said i want to see you
she thought he sounded better she sent him up the fare
he was riding through the cane in the pouring rain
on olympic to her door
to her door to her door to her door
he came in on a sunday every muscle aching
walking in slow motion like he'd just been hit
did they have a future would he know his children
could he make a picture and get them all to fit
he was shaking in his seat riding through the streets
in a silvertop to her
shaking in his seat riding through the streets
in a silvertop to her door
to her door to her door to her door
mull of kintyreoh mist rolling in from the sea
my desire is always to be here oh mull of kintyre
far have i travelled and much have i seen
dark distant mountains with valleys of green
past painted deserts the sun sets on fire
as he carries me home to the mull of kintyre
mull of kintyreoh mist rolling in from the sea
my desire is always to be here oh mull of kintyre
sweep trought the heather like deer in the glen

nights when we sang like a heavenly choir
of the life and the times of the mull of kintyre
mull of kintyreoh mist rolling in from the sea
my desire is always to be here oh mull of kintyre
smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain
still takes me back where my mem´ries remain
flickering embers go higher and higher
as they carry me back to the mull of kintyre
mull of kintyreoh mist rolling in from the sea
my desire is always to be here oh mull of kintyre

in graceland
she comes back to tell me she's gone
as if i didn't know that
as if i didn't know my own bed

is like a window in your heart
everybody sees you're blown apart
everybody sees the wind blow
i'm going to graceland

poorboys and pilgrims with families
and we are going to graceland

who calls herself the human trampoline
and sometimes when i'm falling flying

everybody feels the wind blow

there's some part of me wants to see
graceland
and i may be obliged to defend
every love every ending
or maybe there's no obligations now
maybe i've a reason to believe
we all will be received
in graceland

when i'm feeling blue all i have to do
is take a look at you then i'm not so blue
when you're close to me i can feel your heartbeat
i can hear you breathing in my ear
wouldn't you agree baby you and me got a groovy kind of love
anytime you want to you can turn me into
anything you want to anytime at all
when i kiss your lips oooh i start to shiver

how can i just let you walk away
just let you leave without a trace
when i stand here taking every breath with you ooh
you're the only one who really knew me at all
how can you just walk away from me
when all i can do is watch you leave
cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
and even shared the tears
you're the only one who really knew me at all
so take a look at me now
cause there's just an empty space
and there's nothing left here to remind me
just the memory of your face
oh take a look at me now
cause there's just an empty space
and you coming back to me is against the odds
and that's what i've got to face
i wish i could just make you turn around
turn around and see me cry
there's so much i need to say to you
so many reasons why
you're the only one who really knew me at all
so take a look at me now
cause there's just an empty space
and there's nothing left here to remind me
just the memory of your face
oh take a look at me now
cause there's just an empty space
but to wait for you well that's all i can do
and that's what i've got to face
take a good look at me now
cause i'll still be standing here
and you coming back to me is against all odds
it's the chance i've got to take
take a look at me now

"sir can you help me

i need love love to ease my mind
and i need to find time someone to call mine
my mama said
you can't hurry love
no you just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
but it's a game of give and take
you can't hurry love
no you just have to wait
just trust on a good time
no matter how long it takes
how many heartaches must i stand
before i find the love to let me live again
right now the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
when i feel my strength
oh it's almost gone
i remember mama said
you can't hurry love
no you just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
but it's a game of give and take
how long must i wait
how much more must i take
before loneliness
will 'cause my heart heart to break
no one can bear to live a life alone
i grow impatient for a love to call my own
but when i feel that i i can't go on
well these precious words
keep me hangin' on
i remember mama said
you can't hurry love
no you just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
but it's a game of give and take
you can't hurry love
no you just have to wait
just trust on a good time
no matter how long it takes
now break
now love love don't come easy
but i keep on waiting anticipating
for that soft voice to talk to me at night
for some tender arms to hold me tight
i keep waiting oh 'til that day
but it ain't easy no you know it ain't easy
my mama said
you can't hurry love
no you just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
but it's a game of give and take
you can't hurry love
no you just have to wait
just trust on a good time
no matter how long it takes
you can't hurry love
no you just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
but it's a game of give and take

it's a sin that somehow
light is changing to shadow
and casting its shroud
over all we have known
unaware how the ranks have grown
driven on by a heart of stone
we could find that we're all alone
in the dream of the proud
on the wings of the night
as the daytime is stirring
where the speechless unite
in a silent accord
using words you will find are strange
and mesmerized as they light the flame
feel the new wind of change
on the wings of the night
no more turning away
from the weak and the weary
no more turning away
from the coldness inside
just a world that we all must share
it's not enough just to stand and stare
is it only a dream that there'll be
no more turning away

shine on you crazy diamond
now there's a look in your eyes like black holes in the sky
shine on you crazy diamond
you were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
blown on the steel breeze
come on you target for faraway laughter
come on you stranger you legend you martyr and shine
you reached for the secret too soon you cried for the moon
shine on you cra zy diamond
threatened by shadows at night and exposed in the light
shine on you crazy diamond
well you wore out your welcome with random precision
rode on the steel breeze
come on you raver you seer of visions
come on you painter you piper you prisoner and shine
nobody knows where you are how near or how far
shine on you cra zy diamond
pile on many more layers and i'll be joining you there
shine on you cra zy diamond
and we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
sail on the steel breeze
come on you boy child you winner and loser
come on you miner for truth and delusion and shine

it was christmas eve babe in the drunktank
an old man said to me won't see another one and then he sang a song
'the rare old mountain dew' and i turned my face away
and dreamed about you
got on a lucky one came in eighteen to one
i've got a feeling this year's for me and you
so happy christmas i love you baby
i can see a better time when all our dreams come true
they've got cars
big as bars
they've got rivers of gold
but the wind goes right through you
it's no place for the old
when you first took my hand
on a cold christmas eve
you promised me
broadway was waiting for me
you were handsome
queen of new york city
when the band finished playing
they howled out for more
sinatra was swinging
all the drunks they were singing
we kissed on the corner
then danced through the night
the boys of the nypd choir
were singing 'galway bay'
and the bells were ringing
out for christmas day
you're a bum
you're a punk
you're an old slut on junk
living there almost dead on a drip
in that bed
you scum bag
you cheap lousy faggot
happy christmas your arse
i pray god
it's our last
the boys of the nypd choir
still singing 'galway bay'
and the bells are ringing
out for christmas day
i could have been someone
well so could anyone
you took my dreams
from me when i first found you
i kept them with me babe
i put them with my own
can't make it all alone
i've built my dreams around you
the boys of the nypd choir
still singing 'galway bay'
and the bells are ringing
out for christmas day
on the fourth of july eighteen hundred and six
we set sail from the sweet cobh of cork
we were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
for the grand city hall in new york
'twas a wonderful craft
she was rigged fore and aft
and oh how the wild wind drove her
she stood several blasts
she had twenty seven masts
and they called her the irish rover
we had one million bags of the best sligo rags
we had two million barrels of stone
we had three million sides of old blind horses hides
we had four million barrels of bones
we had five million hogs
and six million dogs
seven million barrels of porter
we had eight million bails of old nannygoats' tails
in the hold of the irish rover
there was awl mickey coote
who played hard on his flute
when the ladies lined up for a set
he was tootin' with skill
for each sparkling quadrille
though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
with his smart witty talk
he was cock of the walk
and he rolled the dames under and over
they all knew at a glance
when he took up his stance
that he sailed in the irish rover
there was barney mcgee
from the banks of the lee
there was hogan from county tyrone
there was johnny mcgirr
who was scared stiff of work
and a man from westmeath called malone
there was slugger o'toole
who was drunk as a rule
and fighting bill treacy from dover
and your man mick maccann
from the banks of the bann
was the skipper of the irish rover
for a sailor it's always a bother in life
it's so lonesome by night and day
that he longs for the shore
and a charming young whore
who will melt all his troubles away
oh the noise and the rout
swillin' poitin and stout
for him soon the torment's over
of the love of a maid
he is never afraid
an old salt from the irish rover
we had sailed seven years
when the measles broke out
and the ship lost its way in the fog
and that whale of a crew
was reduced down to two
just myself and the captain's old dog
then the ship struck a rock
oh lord what a shock
the bulkhead was turned right over
turned nine times around
and the poor old dog was drowned
i'm the last of the irish rover

we both lie silently still in the dead of the night
although we both lie close together we feel miles apart inside
was it something i said or something i did
did my words not come out right
though i tried not to hurt you though i tried but i guess that's why they say
every rose has its thorn
just like every night has its dawn
just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
every rose has its thorn
i listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
hear the dj say love's a game of easy come and easy go
but i wonder does he know has he ever felt like this
and i know that you'd be here right now if i
coulda let you know somehow i guess
every rose has its thorn
just like every night has its dawn
just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
every rose has its thorn
though it's been a while now i can still feel so much pain
like a knife that cuts you the wound heals but the scar that scar remains
i know i coulda saved our love that night if i'd known what to say
instead of making love we both made our separate ways
and now i hear you've found somebody new and that i never meant that much to you
to hear that tears me up inside and to see you cuts me like a knife i guess
every rose has its thorn
just like every night has its dawn
just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
every rose has its thorn

i was working part time in a fiveanddime
my boss was mr mcgee
he told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'cause i was a bit leisurely
seems that i was busy doing something close nothing
but different than the day before
that's when i saw her ooh i saw her
she walked in through the out door out door
she wore a raspberry beret
the kind u find in a second hand store
raspberry beret
and if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
raspberry beret
i think i love her
built like she was uh she had the nerve ask me
if i planned do her any harm
so look here i put her on the back of my bike anda we went riding
down by old man johnson's farm
i said now overcast days never turned me on
but something about the clouds and her mixed
she wasn't bright but i could tell
when she kissed me
she wore a raspberry beret
the kind u find in a second hand store
raspberry beret
and if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
raspberry beret
i think i love her
the rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
listen they say the first time ain't the greatest
i wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby i'm the most
with a girl as fine as she was then
dig if you will the picture
of you and i engaged in a kiss
the sweat of your body covers me
can you my darling
can you picture this
dream if you can a courtyard
an ocean of violets in bloom
animals strike curious poses
they feel the heat
the heat between me and you
how can you just leave me standing
alone in a world that's so cold so cold
maybe i'm just too demanding
maybe i'm just like my father too bold
maybe you're just like my mother
she's never satisfied she's never satisfied
why do we scream at each other
this is what it sounds like
when doves cry
touch if you will my stomach
feel how it trembles inside
you've got the butterflies all tied up
don't make me chase you
even doves have pride
how can you just leave me standing
alone in a world that's so cold so cold

it’s a kind of magic it’s a kind of magic a kind of magic
one dream one soul
one prize one goal
one golden glance
of what should be
one shaft of light
that shows the way
no mortal man
can win this day
the bell that rings
inside your mind
is challenging
the doors of time
the waiting seems eternity
the day will dawn on sanity
is this a kind of magic
there can be only one
this rage that lasts a thousand years will soon be gone
this flame that burns inside of me
i’m hearing secret harmonies
the bell that rings inside your mind
is challenging the doors of time
it’s a kind of magic
it’s a kind of magic
this rage that lasts a thousand years

radio
i'd sit alone and watch your light
my only friend through teenage nights
and everything i had to know
i heard it on my radio
you gave them all those old time stars
through wars of worlds invaded by mars
you made 'em laugh you made 'em cry
you made us feel like we could fly
radio
so don't become some background noise
a backdrop for the girls and boys
who just don't know or just don't care
and just complain when you're not there
you had your time you had the power
you've yet to have your finest hour
radio radio
all we hear is radio ga ga
radio goo goo radio ga ga
all we hear is radio ga ga
radio blah blah
radio what's new
radio someone still loves you
we watch the shows we watch the stars
on videos for hours and hours
we hardly need to use our ears
how music changes through the years
let's hope you never leave old friend
like all good things on you we depend
so stick around cause we might miss you
when we grow tired of all this visual
you had your time you had the power
you've yet to have your finest hour
radio radio
all we hear is radio ga ga
radio blah blah
radio what's new
someone still loves you

fade out
it started off so well
they said we made a perfect pair
i clothed myself in your glory and your love
how i loved you
how i cried
the years of care and loyalty
were nothing but a sham it seems
the years belie we lived a lie
"i love you till i die"
save me save me save me
i cant't face this life alone
save me save me save me
i'm naked and i'm far from home
the slate will soon be clear
i'll erase the memories
to start again with somebody new
was it all wasted
all that love
i hang my head and i advertise
a soul for sale or rent
i have no heart i'm cold inside
i have no real intent
save me save me save me
i can't face me life alone
save me save me save me
i'm naked and i'm far from home
each night i cry i still believe the lie
i love you till i die
save me save me save me save me save me oooh save me
don't let me face my life alone
save me save me oooooohhh
i'm naked and i'm far from home
oh my love we've had our share of tears
oh my friend we've had our hopes and fears
oh my friends it's been a long hard year
but now it's christmas
yes it's christmas
thank god it's christmas
the moon and stars seem awful cold and bright
let's hope the snow will make this christmas right
my friend the world will share this special night
because it's christmas
yes it's christmas
thank god it's christmas
for one night
thank god it's christmas yeah
thank god it's christmas
thank god it's christmas
can it be christmas

thank god it's christmas
oooh yeah
thank god it's christmas
yes yes yes yes it's christmas
thank god it's christmas
for one day
i'm just the pieces of the man i used to be
too many bitter tears are raining down on me
i'm far away from home
and i've been facing this alone
for much too long
oh i feel like noone ever told the truth to me
about growing up and what a struggle it would be
in my tangled state of mind
i've been looking back to find
where i went wrong
too much love will kill you
if you can't make up your mind
torn between the lover
and the love you leave behind
you're headed for disaster
'cos you never read the signs
too much love will kill you
every time
i'm just the shadow of the man i used to be
and it seems like there's no way out of this for me
i used to bring you sunshine
now all i ever do is bring you down
ooh how would it be if you were standing in my shoes
can't you see that it's impossible to choose
no there's no making sense of it
every way i go i'm bound to lose
too much love will kill you
just as sure as none at all
it'll drain the power that's in you
make you plead and scream and crawl
and the pain will make you crazy
you're the victim of your crime
too much love will kill you
every time
yes too much love will kill you
it'll make your life a lie
yes too much love will kill you
and you won't understand why
you'd give your life you'd sell you soul
but here it comes again
too much love will kill you
in the end
in the end

well i've heard those city singers singin about how they can love
deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above
well i come from the country and i know i ain't seen it all
but i heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall
but that would not do justice to the way i feel for you
so i have to sing this song about all the things i knew
my love is deeper than the holler stronger than the rivers
higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
my love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late december
and honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
and longer than the song of the whippoorwill
from the backroads to the broadway shows with a million miles between
there's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
and everyone is different and everyone's the same
so this is just another way of sayin the same thing
my love is deeper than the holler stronger than the rivers
higher than the pine trees growin tall upon the hill
my love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late december
and honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
and longer than the song of the whippoorwill
you may think that i'm talking foolish
you've heard that i'm wild i'm free
you may wonder how i can promise you now
this love that i feel for you always will be
well you're not just time that i'm killing
i'm no longer one of those guys
as sure as i live this love that i give
is gonna be yours until the day that i die oh baby
i'm gonna love you forever forever ever amen
as long as old men sit talk about the weather
as long as old women sit talk about old men
if you wonder how long i'll be faithful
i'll be happy to tell you again
i'm gonna love you forever ever forever ever amen
they say time takes it's toll on a body
makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey
but honey i don't care i ain't in love with your hair
and if it all fell out well i'd love you anyway
they say that time can play tricks on a memory
make people forget things they knew
but it's easy to see it's happening to me
i've already forgotten every woman but you oh darlin'
i'm gonna love you forever forever ever amen
as long as old men sit talk about the weather
as long as old women sit talk about old men
if you wonder how long i'll be faithful
just listen to how this song ends
i'm gonna love you forever ever forever ever amen
i'm gonna love you forever ever forever ever
forever ever forever ever amen
suppose i called you up tonight
and told you that i loved you
and suppose i said "i wanna come back home"
and suppose i cried and said "i think i finally learned my lesson
and i'm tired of spending all my time alone
if i told you that i realized you're all i ever wanted
and it's killing me to be so far away
would you tell me that you loved me too and would we cry together
or would you simply laugh at me and say
"i told you so oh i told you so
i told you someday you would come crawling back
and asking me to take you in
i told you so but you had to go
now i found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"
if i got down on my knees
and told you i was yours forever
would you get down on yours too and take my hand
would we get that oldtime feeling
would we laugh and talk for hours
the way we did when our love first began
would you tell me that you've missed me too
and that you've been so lonely
and you've waited for the day that i returned
and we'd live and love forever
and that i'm your one and only
or would you say the tables finally turned
"i told you so oh i told you so
i told you someday you would come crawling back
and asking me to take you in
i told you so but you had to go
now i found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"
pretty paper pretty ribbons of blue
wrap your present to your darlin' from you
pretty pencils to write i love you
oh oh pretty paper pretty ribbons of blue
crowded streets busy feet hustle by him
downtown shoppers christmas is nigh
there he sits all alone on the sidewalk
hoping that you won't pass him by
should you stop better not much to busy
you'd better hurry my how time does fly
and in the distance the ringing of laughter
and in the midst of the laughter he cries
pretty paper pretty ribbons of blue
wrap your present to your darlin' from you
pretty pencils to write i love you
oh oh pretty paper pretty ribbons of blue

à m'asseoir sur un banc cinq minutes avec toi
et regarder les gens tant qu'y en a
te parler du bon temps qu'est mort ou qui reviendra
en serrant dans ma main tes p'tits doigts
puis donner à bouffer à des pigeons idiots
leur filer des coups d'pieds pour de faux
et entendre ton rire qui lézarde les murs
qui sait surtout guérir mes blessures
te raconter un peu comment j'étais minot les bonbecs fabuleux
qu'on piquait chez l' marchand carensac et minto caramel à un franc
et les mistrals gagnants
à r'marcher sous la pluie cinq minutes avec toi
et regarder la vie tant qu'il en a
te raconter la terre en te bouffant des yeux
te parler de ta mère un p'tit peu
et sauter dans les flaques pour la faire râler
bousiller nos godasses et s'marrer
et entendre ton rire comme on entend la mer
s'arrêter repartir en arrière
te raconter surtout les carambars d'antan et les coco boers
et les vrais roudoudous qui nous coupaient les lèvres et nous niquaient les dents
et les mistrals gagnants

à m'asseoir sur un banc cinq minutes avec toi
et regarder le soleil qui s'en va
te parler du bon temps qui est mort et je m'en fous
te dire que les méchants c'est pas nous
que si moi je suis barge ce n'est que de tes yeux
car ils ont l'avantage d'être deux
et entendre ton rire s'envoler aussi haut
que s'envolent les cris des oiseaux
te raconter enfin qu'il faut aimer la vie et l'aimer même si
le temps est assassin et emporte avec lui les rires des enfants
et les mistrals gagnants

i can't fight this feeling any longer
and yet i'm still afraid to let it flow
what started out as friendship has grown stronger
i only wish i had the strength to let it show
i tell myself that i can't hold out forever
i say there is no reason for my fear
cause i feel so secure when were together
you give my life direction
you make everything so clear
and even as i wander
i'm keeping you in sight
you're a candle in the window
on a cold dark winters night
and i'm getting closer than i ever thought i might
and i can't fight this feeling anymore
i've forgotten what i started fighting for
it's time to bring this ship into the shore
and throw away the oars forever
cause i can't fight this feeling anymore
i've forgotten what i started fighting for
and if i have to crawl upon the floor
come crashing through your door
baby i can't fight this feeling anymore
my life has been such a whirlwind since i saw you
i've been running round in circles in my mind
and it always seems that i'm following you girl
cause you take me to the places that alone i'd never find
and even as i wander
i'm keeping you in sight
you're a candle in the window
on a cold dark winters night
and i'm getting closer than i ever thought i might
and i can't fight this feeling anymore
i've forgotten what i started fighting for
it's time to bring this ship into the shore
and throw away the oars forever
cause i can't fight this feeling anymore
i've forgotten what i started fighting for
and if i have to crawl upon the floor
come crashing through your door
baby i can't fight this feeling anymore
you should've seen by the look in my eyes baby
there was something missing
you should've known by the tone of my voice maybe
but you didn't listen
you played dead
but you never bled
instead you lay still in the grass
all coiled up and hissing
and though i know all about those men
still i don't remember
cause it was us baby way before then
and we're still together
and i meant every word i said
when i said that i love you i meant
that i love you forever
and i'm gonna keep on lovin you

i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that
i'm just an average man with an average life
i work from nine to five hey hell i pay the price
but all i want is to be left alone in my average home
but why do i always feel like i'm in the twilight zone
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
tell me is it just a dream
when i come home at night
i bolt the door real tight
people call me on the phone i'm trying to avoid
well can the people on tv see me or am i just paranoid
when i'm in the shower i'm afraid to wash my hair
'cos i might open my eyes and find someone standing there
people say i'm crazy just a little touched
but maybe showers remind me of psycho too much that's why
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
who's playing tricks on me
i don't know any more are the neighbours watching me
well is the mailman watching me
and i don't feel safe any more oh what a mess
i wonder who's watching me now who the irs
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
tell me is it just a dream
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
who's playing tricks on me
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
tell me who can it be
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody's watchin' me
or playin' tricks on me
may the good lord be with you down every road you roam
and may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home
and may you grow to be proud dignified and true
and do unto others as you'd have done to you
be courageous and be brave and in my heart you'll always stay
forever young forever young
forever young forever young
may good fortune be with you may your guiding light be strong
build a stairway to heaven with a prince or a vagabond
and may you never love in vain and in my heart you will remain
forever young forever young
forever young forever young
forever young
forever young
and when you finally fly away i'll be hoping that i served you well
for all the wisdom of a lifetime no one can ever tell
but whatever road you choose i'm right behind you win or lose
forever young forever young
forever young forever young
forever young
forever young
for forever young
forever young
lay a whisper on my pillow
leave the winter on the ground
i wake up lonely there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around
touch me now i close my eyes and dream away
it must have been love but it's over now
it must have been good but i lost it somehow
it must have been love but it's over now
from the moment we touched till the time had run out
makebelieving we're together
that i'm sheltered by your heart
but in and outside i've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm
and it's a hard winter's day i dream away
it must have been love but it's over now
it was all that i wanted now i'm living without
it must have been love but it's over now
it's where the water flows it's where the wind blows
it must have been love but it's over now
it must have been good but i lost it somehow
it must have been love but it's over now
from the moment we touched till the time had run out
yeah it must have been love but it's over now
it was all i wanted now i'm living without
it must have been love but it's over now
it's where the water flows it's where the wind blows
it must have been love but it's over now fade out
i know there's something in the wake of your smile
i get a notion from the look in your eyes yeah
you've built a love but that love falls apart
your little piece of heaven turns too dark
listen to your heart when he's calling for you
listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
i don't know where you're going and i don't know why
but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye
sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
the precious moments are all lost in the tide yeah
they're swept away and nothing is what is seems
the feeling of belonging to your dreams
listen to your heart when he's calling for you
listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
i don't know where you're going and i don't know why
but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye
and there are voices that want to be heard
so much to mention but you can't find the words
the scent of magic the beauty that's been
when love was wilder than the wind
listen to your heart when he's calling for you
listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
i don't know where you're going and i don't know why
but listen to your heart before
listen to your heart when he's calling for you
listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
i don't know where you're going and i don't know why
but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye
listen to your heart
listen to your heart take a listen to it
listen to your heart
listen to your heart take a take a listen to it
listen to your heart
listen to your heart oh oh
listen to your heart oh ooh oh
listen to your heart oh oh oh
listen to your heart oh oh
listen to your heart oh oh oh
listen to your heart oh oh
listen to your heart oh yeah yeah yeah
listen to your heart oh oh

it's early morning
the sun comes out
last night was shaking
and pretty loud
my cat is purring
and scratches my skin
so what is wrong
with another sin
the bitch is hungry
she needs to tell
so give her inches
and feed her well
more days to come
new places to go
i've got to leave
it's time for a show
here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane
my body is burning
it starts to shout
desire is coming
it breaks out loud
lust is in cages
till the storm breaks loose
just have to make it
with someone i choose
the night is calling
i have to go
the wolf is hungry
he runs to show
he's licking his lips
he's ready to win
on the hunt tonight
for love at first sting
here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane

woke up to the sound of pouring rain
the wind would whisper and i'd think of you
and all the tears you cried that called my name
and when you needed me i came through
i paint a picture of the days gone by
when love went blind and you would make me see
i'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
so that i knew you were there for me
time after time you were there for me
remember yesterday walking hand in hand
love letters in the sand i remember you
through the sleepless nights and every endless day
i'd wanna hear you say i remember you
we spend the summer with the top rolled down
wished ever after would be like this
you said i love you babe without a sound
i said i'd give my life for just one kiss
i'd live for your smile and die for your kiss
remember yesterday walking hand in hand
love letters in the sand i remember you
through the sleepless nights and every endless day
i'd wanna hear you say i remember you
we've had our share of hard times
but that's the price we paid
and through it all we kept the promise that we made
woke up to the sound of pouring rain
washed away a dream of you
but nothing else could ever take you away
'cause you'll always be my dream come true
oh my darling i love you
remember yesterday walking hand in hand
love letters in the sand i remember you
through the sleepless nights and every endless day
i'd wanna hear you say i remember you
remember yesterday walking hand in hand
love letters in the sand i remember you
through the sleepless nights and every endless day
i'd wanna hear you say i remember i remember you

sometimes i feel i've got to
run away i've got to
get away
from the pain you drive into the heart of me
the love we share seems to
go nowhere
and i've lost my light
for i toss and turn i can't sleep at night
once i ran to you now i run from you
this tainted love you've given
i give you all a boy could give you
take my tears and that's not nearly
all tainted love oh oh oh
tainted love
now i know i've got to
run away i've got to
get away
you don't really want any more from me
to make things right
you need someone to hold you tight
and you think love is to pray
but i'm sorry i don't pray that way
once i ran to you now i run from you
this tainted love you've given
i give you all a boy could give you
take my tears and that's not nearly
all tainted love oh oh oh
tainted love
don't touch me please
i can not stand the way you tease
i love you though you hurt me so
now i'm going to pack my things and go
tainted love oh oh oh
tainted love oh oh oh
tainted love oh oh oh
tainted love oh oh oh
touch me baby tainted love
touch me baby tainted love
tainted love oh oh oh
tainted love oh oh oh
so true funny how it seems
always in time but never in line for dreams
head over heels when toe to toe
this is the sound of my soul
this is the sound
i bought a ticket to the world
but now i've come back again
why do i find it hard to write the next line
oh i want the truth to be said
huh huh huh huuh huh
i know this much is true
huh huh huh huuh huh
i know this much is true
with a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
dissolve the nerves that just begun
listening to marvin all night long
this is the sound of my soul
this is the sound
always slipping from my hands
sands of time i've been told
take your seats and i'll write the next line
oh i want the truth to be known
huh huh huh huuh huh
i know this much is true
huh huh huh huuh huh
i know this much is true
i bought a ticket to the world
but now i've come back again
why do i find it hard to write the next line
oh i want the truth to be said
huh huh huh huuh huh
i know this much is true
huh huh huh huuh huh
i know this much is true
this much is true
ah for just one time
i would take the northwest passage
to find the hand of franklin
reaching for the beaufort sea
tracing one warm line
through a land so wide and savage and
make a northwest passage to the sea
westward from the davis strait
'tis there was said to lie
the sea route to the orient
for which so many died
seeking gold and glory
leaving weathered broken bones and
a long forgotten lonely cairn of stones
ah for just one time
i would take the northwest passage
to find the hand of franklin
reaching for the beaufort sea
tracing one warm line
through a land so wide and savage and
make a northwest passage to the sea
three centuries there after
i take passage over land
in the footsteps of brave kelso
where his "sea of flowers" be gan
watching cities rise be fore me
then be hind me sink a gain
this tardiest ex plorer
driving hard a cross the plains
ah for just one time
i would take the northwest passage
to find the hand of franklin
reaching for the beaufort sea
tracing one warm line
through a land so wide and savage and
make a northwest passage to the sea
and through the night be hind the wheel
the mileage clicking west
i think upon mac kenzie
david thompson and the rest
who cracked the mountain ramparts and
did show a path for me
to race the roaring fraser to the sea
ah for just one time
i would take the northwest passage
to find the hand of franklin
reaching for the beaufort sea
tracing one warm line
through a land so wide and savage and
make a northwest passage to the sea
how then am i so different
from the first men through this way
like them i left a settled life
i threw it all a way
to seek a northwest passage
at the call of many men
to find there but the road back home a gain
ah for just one time
i would take the northwest passage
to find the hand of franklin
reaching for the beaufort sea
tracing one warm line
through a land so wide and savage and
make a northwest passage to the sea
looking in your eyes i see a paradise
this world that i've found
is too good to be true
standing here beside you
want so much to give you
this love in my heart that i'm feeling for you
let 'em say we're crazy i don't care about that

time
i've been passing time watching trains go by
all of my life
lying on the sand watching seabirds fly
wishing there would be
someone waiting home for me
something's telling me it might be you
it's telling me it might be you
all of my life
looking back as lovers go walking past
all of my life
wondering how they met and what makes it last
if i found the place
would i recognize the face
something's telling me it might be you
yeah it's telling me it might be you
so many quiet walks to take
so many dreams to wake
and we've so much love to make
i think we're gonna need some time
maybe all we need is time
and it's telling me it might be you
all of my life
i've been saving love songs and lullabies
and there's so much more
no one's ever heard before
something's telling me it might be you
yeah it's telling me it must be you
and i'm feeling it'll just be you
all of my life
it's you
it's you
i've been waiting for
all of my life
maybe it's you
maybe it's you
i've been waiting for
all of my life
maybe it's you
maybe it's you
i've been waiting for
all of my life

well my name's john lee pettimore
you hardly ever saw grandaddy down here
he'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line
now the revenue man wanted grandaddy bad
he headed up the holler with everything he had
it's before my time but i've been told
he never came back from copperhead road
now daddy ran the whiskey in a big block dodge
johnson county sheriff painted on the side
well him and my uncle tore that engine down
well the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
heard mama cryin' knew something wasn't right
he was headed down to knoxville with the weekly load
you could smell the whiskey burnin' down copperhead road
i volunteered for the army on my birthday
i done two tours of duty in vietnam
i take the seed from colombia and mexico
well the dea's got a chopper in the air
i wake up screaming like i'm back over there
i learned a thing or two from ol' charlie don't you know
you better stay away from copperhead road

just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh ooh ooh
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
and the days go by like a strand in the wind
in the web that is my own i begin again
said to my friend baby nothing else mattered
he was no more he was no more than a baby then
well he seemed brokenhearted
something within him
but the moment that i first laid eyes on him
all alone on the edge of seventeen
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
well i went today maybe i will go again tomorrow
yeah yeah and the music there well it was hauntingly familiar
when i see you doin what i try to do for me
with the words from a poet and a voice from a choir
and a melody nothin else mattered
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
the clouds never expect it when it rains but the sea changes color
but the sea does not change
so with the slow graceful glow of age
i went forth with an ageold desire to please
on the edge of seventeen
ooh
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
well then suddenly there was no one left standin in the hall
yeah yeah in a flood of tears that no one really ever heard fall at all
well i went searchin for an answer up the stairs and down the hall
not to find an answer but just to hear the call of a nightbird
singin come away come away come away
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
well i hear you in the mornin' and i hear you at nightfall
and sometimes to be near you is to be unable to feel you my love
i'm a few years older than you my love
just like the whitewinged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
ooh baby ooh said ooh
is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
shatter with words impossible to follow
you're saying i'm fragile i try not to be
i search only for something i can't see
i have my own life and i'm stronger than you know
but i carry this feeling when you walked into my house
that you won't be walking out the door
still i carry this feeling when you walked into my house
that you won't be walking out the door
lovers forever face to face
my city your mountains stay with me stay
i need you to love me i need you today
give to me your leather take from me my lace
you in the moonlight with your sleepy eyes
could you ever love a man like me
and you were right when i walked into your house
i knew i'd never want to leave
sometimes i'm a strong man sometimes cold and scared
and sometimes i cry
but that time i saw you i knew with you
to light my nights somehow i'd get by
first time i saw you i knew with you
to light my nights somehow i would get by
lovers forever face to face
my city your mountains stay with me stay
i need you to love me i need you today
give to me your leather take from me my lace
lovers forever face to face
my city your mountains stay with me stay
i need you to love me i need you today
give to me your leather take from me my lace

well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind
my baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine
she's my sweet little thing she's my pride and joy
she's my sweet little baby i'm her little lover boy
yeah i love my baby my heart and soul
love like ours won't never grow old
she's my sweet little thing she's my pride and joy
she's my sweet little baby i'm her little lover boy

yeah i love my baby my heart and soul
love like ours will never grow old
she's my sweet little thing she's my pride and joy
she's my sweet little baby i'm her little lover boy
lately i have had this strangest feeling
with no vivid reasons here to find
yet the thought of losing you's been hanging round my mind
far more frequently you're wearing perfume
with you say "no special place to go"
but when i ask will you be coming back soon
you don't know never know
well i'm a man of many wishes
i hope my premonition misses
but what i really feel my eyes won't let me hide
cause they always start to cry
cause this time could mean goodbye
lately i've been staring in the mirror
very slowly picking me apart
tryin' to tell myself i have no reason with your heart
just the other night while you were sleeping
i vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
but when i ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
you just say nothing's changed
well i'm a man of many wishes
i hope my premonition misses
but what i really feel my eyes won't let me hide
cause they always start to cry
cause this time could mean goodbye
goodbye
well i'm a man of many wishes
i hope my premonition misses
but what i really feel my eyes won't let me hide
cause they always start to cry
cause this time could mean goooooooooodbye

call up ring once hang up the phone to let me know made it home
don't want nothing to be wrong with parttime lovers
if she's with me i'll blink the lights to let you know tonight's the night
for me and you my parttime lover
we are undercover passion on the run
chasing love up against the su u uun
we are strangers by day lovers by night
knowing it's so wrong but feeling so right
if i'm with friends and we should meet just pass me by don't even speak
know the word's "discreet" with parttime lovers
but if there's some emergency have a male friend to ask for me
so then she won't peek it's really you my parttime lover
we are undercover passion on the run
chasing love up against the su u uun
we are strangers by day lovers by night
knowing it's so wrong but feeling so right
da da da da da da da da

we are undercover passion on the run
chasing love up against the su u uun
we are strangers by day lovers by night
knowing it's so wrong but feeling so right
i've got something that i must tell last night someone rang our doorbell
and it was not you my parttime lover
and then a man called our exchange but didn't want to leave his name
i guess that two can play the game of parttime lovers
you and me parttime lovers
but she and he parttime lovers
i don't drink coffee i take tea my dear
i like my toast done on one side
and you can hear it in my accent when i talk
i'm an englishman in new york
see me walking down fifth avenue
a walking cane here at my side
i take it everywhere i walk
i'm an englishman in new york
i'm an alien i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york
i'm an alien i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york
if "manners maketh man" as someone said
then he's the hero of the day
it takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
be yourself no matter what they say
i'm an alien i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york
i'm an alien i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york
modesty propriety can lead to notoriety
you could end up as the only one
gentleness sobriety are rare in this society
at night a candle's brighter than the sun
takes more than combat gear to make a man
takes more than a license for a gun
confront your enemies avoid them when you can
a gentleman will walk but never run
if "manners maketh man" as someone said
then he's the hero of the day
it takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
be yourself no matter what they say
i'm an alien i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york
i'm an alien i'm a legal alien
i'm an englishman in new york
if blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
drying in the colour of the evening sun
tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
but something in our minds will always stay
perhaps this final act was meant
to clinch a lifetime's argument
that nothing comes from violence
and nothing ever could
for all those born beneath an angry star
lest we forget how fragile we are
on and on the rain will fall
like tears from a star
on and on the rain will say
how fragile we are
on and on the rain will fall
like tears from a star
on and on the rain will say
how fragile we are

risin' up back on the street
did my time took my chances
went the distance now i'm back on my feet
just a man and his will to survive
so many times it happens too fast
you change your passion for glory
don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
you must fight just to keep them alive
it's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight
rising up to the challenge of our ri val
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
and he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
face to face out in the heat
hangin' tough stayin' hungry
they stack the odds still we take to the street
for we kill with the skill to survive
it's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight
rising up to the challenge of our ri val
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
and he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
risin' up straight to the top
had the guts got the glory
went the distance now i'm not gonna stop
just a man and his will to survive
it's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight
rising up to the challenge of our ri val
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
and he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
the eye of the tiger
the eye of the tiger
the eye of the tiger
the eye of the tiger
fade out

how can i convince you what you see is real
who am i to blame you for doubting what you feel
i was always reaching you were just a girl i knew
i took for granted the friend i have in you
i was living for a dream loving for a moment
taking on the world that was just my style
now i look into your eyes i can see forever
the search is over you were with me all the while
can we last forever will we fall apart
at times it's so uncertain these questions of the heart
you've followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
till i came to my senses through some miracle of fate
i was living for a dream loving for a moment
taking on the world that was just my style
now i look into your eyes i can see forever
the search is over you were with me all the while
now the miles stretch out behind me loves that i have lost
broken hearts lie victims of the game
then good luck it finally struck like lightning from the blue
every highway leads me back to you
now at last i hold you now all is said and done
the search has come full circle
our destinies are one
so if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
you'll know for certain the man i really am
i was living for a dream loving for a moment
taking on the world that was just my style
now i look into your eyes i can see forever
the search is over you were with me all the while
then i touched your hands i can hear you whisper
the search is over love was right before my eyes

my name is luka
i live on the second floor
i live upstairs from you
yes i think you've seen me before
if you hear something late at night
some kind of trouble some kind of fight
just don't ask me what it was
just don't ask me what it was
just don't ask me what it was
i think it's because i'm clumsy
i try not to talk too loud
maybe it's because i'm crazy
i try not to act too proud
they only hit you until you cry
and after that you don't ask why
you just don't argue anymore
you just don't argue anymore
you just don't argue anymore
yes i think i'm ok
i walked into the door again
well if you ask that's what i'll say
and it's not your business anyway
i guess i'd like to be alone
with nothing broken nothing thrown
just don't ask me how i am
just don't ask me how i am
just don't ask me how i am
my name is luka
i live on the second floor
i live upstairs from you
yes i think you've seen me before
if you hear something late at night
some kind of trouble some kind of fight
just don't ask me what it was
just don't ask me what it was
just don't ask me what it was
they only hit you until you cry
and after that you don't ask why
you just don't argue anymore
you just don't argue anymore
you just don't argue anymore
funny how i find myself in love with you
if i could buy my reasoning i'd pay to lose
one half won't do
i've asked myself how much do you
commit yourself
it's my life don't you forget
it's my life it never ends
funny how i blind myself i never knew
if i was sometimes played upon afraid to lose
i'd tell myself what good you do
convince myself
it's my life don't you forget
it's my life it never ends
i've asked myself how much do you
commit yourself
it's my life don't you forget
caught in the crowd it never ends… repeat last lines and fade out
and she was lying in the grass
and she could hear the highway breathing
and she could see a nearby factory
she's making sure she is not dreaming
see the lights of the neighbor's house
now she's starting to rise
take a minute to concentrate and she
opens up her eyes
the world was moving she was right there with it and she was
the world was moving she was floating above it and she was
and she was
and she was drifting through the backyard
and she was taking off her dress
and she was moving very slowly
rising up above the earth
moving into the universe and she's
drifting this way and that
not touching the ground at all and she's
up above the yard
the world was moving she was right there with it and she was
the world was moving she was floating above it and she was
and she was glad about it no doubt about it
she isn't sure 'bout what she's done
no time to think about what to tell them
no time to think about what she's done and she was
hey hey heyheyhey
and she was looking at herself
and things were looking like a movie
she had a pleasant elevation
she's moving out in all directions
hey hey hey heyheyhey hey hey hey hey heyheyhey hey
hey hey hey heyheyhey hey hey hey hey heyheyhey hey
the world was moving she was right there with it and she was
the world was moving she was floating above it and she was
joining the world of missing persons and she was
missing enough to feel alright and she was
and she was
and she was

home is where i want to be
pick me up and turn me round
i feel numb born with a weak heart
i guess i must be having fun
the less we say about it the better
make it up as we go along
feet on the ground head in the sky
it's ok i know nothing's wrong nothing
hi yo i got plenty of time
hi yo you got light in your eyes and you’re
and you're standing here beside me
i love the passing of time
never for money always for love
cover up and say goodnight say good night
home is where i want to be
but i guess i'm already there
i come home she lifted up her wings
i guess that this must be the place
i can't tell one from another
did i find you or you find me
there was a time before we were born
if someone asks this where i'll be where i'll be
hi yo we drift in and out
hi yo sing into my mouth
out of all those kinds of people
you got a face with a view
i'm just an animal looking for a home and
share the same space for a minute or two
and you love me till my heart stops
love me till i'm dead
eyes that light up eyes look through you
cover up the blank spots hit me on the head like a
ooooooh
welcome to your life
acting on your best behaviour
turn your back on mother nature
everybody wants to rule the world
it's my own design
help me make the most
of freedom and of pleasure
nothing ever lasts forever
everybody wants to rule the world
there's a room where the light won't find you
holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
when they do i'll be right behind you
so glad we've almost made it
so sad they had to fade it
everybody wants to rule the world
fm g
i can't stand this indecision
married with a lack of vision
everybody wants to rule the world
say that you'll never never never never need it
one headline why believe it
everybody wants to rule the world
all for freedom and for pleasure
nothing ever lasts forever
everybody wants to rule the world
i wanted to be with you alone
and talk about the weather
but traditions i can trace against the child in your face
won't escape my attention
you keep your distance with a system of touch
and gentle persuasion
i'm lost in admiration could i need you this much
oh you're just wasting my time you're just just wasting time
something happens and i'm head over heels
i never find out til i'm head over heels
something happens and i'm head over heels
ah don't take my heart don't break my heart
throw it away
throw it away
i made a fire i'm watching it burn
yeah thought of your future
with one foot in the past now just how long will it last
no no no have you no ambition
my mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air
and dreaming i'm a doctor
it's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
oh i feel so oh
something happens and i'm head over heels
i never find out til i'm head over heels
something happens and i'm head over heels
ah don't take my heart don't break my heart
this is my four leaf clover
i'm on the line one open mind
this is my four leaf clover
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
funny how time flies
all around me are familiar faces
worn out places worn out faces
bright and early for their daily races
going nowhere going nowhere
and their tears are filling up their glasses
no expression no expression
hide my head i want to drown my sorrow
no tomorrow no tomorrow
and i find it kind of funny
i find it kind of sad
the dreams in which i'm dying
are the best i've ever had
i find it hard to tell you
'cause i find it hard to take
when people run in circles it's a very very
mad world
mad world
mad world
mad world
children waiting for the day they feel good
happy birthday happy birthday
made to feel the way that every child should
sit and listen sit and listen
went to school and i was very nervous
no one knew me no one knew me
hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
look right through me look right through me
and i find it kind of funny
i find it kind of sad
the dreams in which i'm dying

all my little plans and schemes
lost like some forgotten dreams
seems that all i really was doing
was waiting for you
just like little girls and boys
playing with their little toys
seems like all they really were doing
was waiting for love
no need to be alone
no need to be alone
it’s real love it’s real yes
it’s real love it’s real
from this moment on i know
exactly where my life will go
seems that all i really was doing
was waiting for love
no need to be afraid
no need to be afraid
it’s real love it’s real yes
it’s real love it’s real
thought i’d been in love before
but in my heart i wanted more
seems like all i really was doing
was waiting for you
no need to be alone
no need to be alone
it’s real love it’s real yes
it’s real love it’s real yes
it’s real love it’s real
it’s real love it’s real yes
it’s real love it’s real
it’s real love it’s real yes
it’s real love it’s real

who's gonna tell you when it's too late
who's gonna tell you things aren't so great
you can't go on thinkin' nothing's wrong
who's gonna drive you home tonight
who's gonna pick you up when you fall
who's gonna hang it up when you call
who's gonna pay attention to your dreams
and who's gonna plug your ears when you scream
you can't go on thinkin' nothing's wrong
who's gonna drive you home tonight
who's gonna hold you down when you shake
who's gonna come around when you break
you can't go on thinkin' nothing's wrong
who's gonna drive you home tonight
you can't go on thinkin' nothing's wrong
who's gonna drive you home tonight
sometimes when this place gets kind of empty
the sound of their breath fades with the light
i think about the loveless fascination
under the milky way tonight
lower the curtain down on memphis
lower the curtain down alright
i've got no time for private consultation
under the milky way tonight
wish i knew what you were looking for
might have known what you would find
and it's something quite peculiar
something shimmering and white
it leads you here despite your destination
under the milky way tonight
wish i knew what you were looking for
might have known what you would find
wish i knew what you were looking for
might have known what you would find
and it's something quite peculiar
something shimmering and white
it leads you here despite your destination
under the milky way tonight
wish i knew what you were looking for
might have known what you would find
wish i knew what you were looking for
might have known what you would find

come closer and see
see into the trees
find the girl
while you can
come closer and see
see into the dark
just follow your eyes
just follow your eyes
i hear her voice
suddenly i stop
the girl was never there
and again
and again
i've waited hours for this
i wish i'd stayed
asleep today
i never thought this day would end
i never thought tonight could ever be
this close to me
just try to see in the dark
to feel the fear before you're here
i make the shapes come much too close
hold my breath and wait until i shake
but if i had your faith
then i could make it safe and clean
if only i was sure
that my head on the door was a dream
i've waited hours for this
i wish i'd stayed asleep today
i never thought this day would end
i never thought tonight could ever be
this close to me
but if i had your face
then i could make it safe and clean
if only i was sure that my head on the door was a dream
yesterday i got so old i felt like i could die
yesterday i got so old it made me wanna cry
go on go on just walk away
go on go on your choice is made
go on go on and disappear
go on go on away from here
and i know i was wrong when i said it was true
that it could've been me and with her in between without you
yesterday i got so scared i shivered like a child
yesterday i got so scared i shivered like a child
yesterday away from you it made me want to cry
go on go on don't walk away
go on go on your choice is made
come back come back why can't you see
come back come back come back to me
and i know i was wrong when i said it was true
that it couldn't be me and be her in between
without you
without you

"show me how you do that trick
the one that makes me scream" she said
"the one that makes me laugh" she said
and threw her arms around my neck
"show me how you do it
and i promise you i promise that
i'll run away with you
i'll run away with you"
spinning on that dizzy edge
i kissed her face and kissed her head
and dreamed of all the different ways i had
to make her glow
"why are you so far away" she said
"why won't you ever know that i'm in love with you
that i'm in love with you"
you
soft and only
you
lost and lonely
you
strange as angels
dancing in the deepest oceans
daylight licked me into shape
i must have been asleep for days
and moving lips to breathe her name
i opened up my eyes
and found myself alone alone
alone above a raging sea
that stole the only girl i loved
and drowned her deep inside of me
you
soft and only
you
lost and lonely
you
just like heaven
whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am home again
whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am whole again
whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am young again
whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am fun again
however far away
i will always love you
however long i stay
i will always love you
whatever words i say
i will always love you
i will always love you
whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am free again
whenever i'm alone with you
you make me feel like i am clean again
however far away
i will always love you
however long i stay
i will always love you
whatever words i say
i will always love you
i will always love you

on candystripe legs spiderman comes
softly through the shadow of the evening sun
stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
looking for the victim shivering in bed
searching out fear in the gathering gloom
and suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
and there is nothing i can do when i realise with fright
that the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight
e|||
quietly he laughs and shaking his head
creeps closer now closer to the foot of the bed
and softer than shadow and quicker than flies
his arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
"be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
don't struggle like that or i will only love you more
for it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
the spiderman is having you for dinner tonight"
and i feel like i'm being eaten
by a thousand million shivering furry holes
and i know that in the morning
i will wake up in the shivering cold
and the spiderman is always hungry

i've been looking so
long at these pictures
of you that i almost
real i've been living
pictures of you
that i almost
the pictures are
all i can feel
remembering
quiet in the rain
as i ran to your
heart to be near
and we kissed as
holding you close
how i always held
close in your fear
remembering
you running soft
you were bigger
whiter than snow
and screamed at
screamed at the
finally found
all your courage
to let it all go
remembering
into my arms
crying for the
heart you were
stone white
lost in the cold
you were always
so lost in the dark
remembering
you how you
slow drowned
so much more than
everything hold
then slip away
quietly open my
eyes but i never
if only i'd thought
of the right words
i could have held
on to your heart
if only i'd thought
of the right
words i wouldn't
apart all my
pictures of you
looking so long at
these pictures of
you but i never
heart looking so
long for the words
always just
breaking apart
my pictures of you
there was nothing
that i ever wanted
more than to feel
you deep in my heart
there was nothing in
ever wanted more than
to never feel the
breaking apart all
my pictures of you

a police car and a screaming siren
pneumatic drill and ripped up concrete
a baby wailing stray dog howling
the screech of brakes and a lamp light blinking
that's entertainment
that's entertainment
a smash of glass and a rumble of boots
an electric train and a ripped up phone booth
paint splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat
lights going out and a kick in the balls
that's entertainment
that's entertainment ahh
la la la la la la
days of speed and slow time mondays
pissing down with rain on a boring wednesday
watching the news not eating your tea
a freezing cold flat and damp on the walls
that's entertainment
that's entertainment ahh
la la la la la la
waking up at on a cool warm morning
opening the windows and breathing in petrol
an amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard
watching the telly and thinking 'bout your holidays
that's entertainment
that's entertainment ahh
la la la la la la
waking up from a bad dream and smoking cigarrettes
cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
a hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac
feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away
that's entertainment
that's entertainment ahh
la la la la la la
two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight
two lovers missing the tranquillity of solitude
getting a cab and travelling on buses
reading graffiti 'bout slashed seat affairs
that's entertainment

that's entertainment
that's entertainment ahh
beautiful star of bethlehem
shining afar through shadows dim
giving the light to those who long have gone
guiding the wise men on their way
unto the place where jesus lay
beautiful star of bethlehem shine on
oh beautiful star beautiful beautiful star
of bethlehem star of bethlehem
shine upon us until the glory dawns
give us the lamp to light the way
unto the land of perfect day
beautiful star of bethlehem shine on
beautiful star the hope of light
guiding the pilgrims through the night
over the mountains 'til the break of dawn
into the light of perfect day
it will give out a lovely ray
beautiful star of bethlehem shine on
beautiful star the hope of rest
for the redeemed the good and the blessed
yonder in glory when the crown is won
jesus is now that star divine
brighter and brighter he will shine
beautiful star of bethlehem shine on
grandpa tell me 'bout the good old days
sometimes it feels like this world's gone crazy
grandpa take me back to yesterday
when the line between right and wrong
didn't seem so hazy
did lovers really fall in love to stay
and stand beside each other come what may
was a promise really something people kept
not just something they would say
did families really bow their heads to pray
did daddies really never go away
oh grandpa tell me 'bout the good old days
grandpa everything is changing fast
we call it progress but i just don't know
and grandpa let's wander back into the past
and paint me the picture of long ago
did lovers really fall in love to stay
and stand beside each other come what may
was a promise really something people kept
not just something they would say and then forget
did families really bow their heads to pray
did daddies really never go away
oh grandpa tell me 'bout the good old days
josie's on a vacation far away
come around and talk it over
so many things that i wanna to say

i just wanna use your love tonight
i don't wanna lose your love tonight
try to stop my hands from shakin'
somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense

i can't hide the way i'm feelin'
as you leave me please would you close the door
and don't forget what i told you
just 'cause you're right that don't mean i'm wrong

i was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
but heaven knows i'm miserable now
i was looking for a job and then i found a job
and heaven knows i'm miserable now
in my life
why do i give valuable time
to people who don't care if i live or die
two lovers entwined pass me by
and heaven knows i'm miserable now

what she asked of me at the end of the day
caligula would have blushed
"oh you've been in the house too long" she said

i am the son and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
of nothing in particular
you shut your mouth how can you say
i go about things the wrong way
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does
i am the son and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
oh of nothing in particular
you shut your mouth
you shut your mouth how can you say
i go about things the wrong way
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does
there's a club if you'd like to go
you could meet somebody who really loves you
so you go and you stand on your own
and you leave on your own
and you go home and you cry
and you want to die
when you say it's gonna happen "now"
well when exactly do you mean
see i've already waited too long
and all my hope is gone
you shut your mouth how can you say
i go about things the wrong way
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does
oh mother i can feel the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
oh well enough said
i know it's over still i cling
i don't know where else i can go mother
oh mother i can feel the soil falling over my head
see the sea wants to take me
do you think you can help me
sad veiled bride please be happy
handsome groom give her room
loud loutish lover treat her kindly
although she needs you more than she loves you
and i know it's over still i cling
i don't know where else i can go
it's over it's over it's over
||
i know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said
"if you're so funny then why are you on your own tonight
||
and if you're so clever then why are you on your own tonight
if you're so very entertaining then why are you on your own tonight
if you're so very good looking why do you sleep alone tonight
||
i know cause tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms"

it's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
it's over over over
then

it's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
it's over over over
love is natural and real
but not for you my love
not tonight my love
love is natural and real
but not for such as you and i my love

so you run down
to the safety of the town

only slightly only slightly less than i used to my love

i was delayed i was waylaid
an emergency stop i smelled the last ten seconds of life
i crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make a shy bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass murder
who said i'd lied to her
oh who said i'd lied because i never i never
who said i'd lied because i never
e||
i was detained i was restrained
i broke my spleen and broke my knee and then he really lays into me
friday night in outpatients
who said i'd lied to her
oh who said i lied because i never i never
who said i'd lied because i never
and so i drank one it became four
and when i fell on the floor i drank more
e||
stop me oh stop me
stop me if you think you've heard this one before
stop me oh stop me

nothing's changed i still love you oh i still love you

take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
i never never want to go home
because i haven't got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because i want to see people and i
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please don't drop me home
because it's not my home it's their home
and i'm welcome no more
and if a doubledecker bus
crashes into us
to die by your side
is such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere i don't care
i don't care
and in the darkened underpass
i thought oh god my chance has come at last
but then a strange fear gripped me and i
just couldn't ask
take me out tonight
take me anywhere i don't care
i don't care
just driving in your car
i never never want to go home
because i haven't got one
i haven't got one
and if a doubledecker bus
crashes into us
to die by your side
is such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure the privilege is mine
there is a light and it never goes out
there is a light and it never goes out
a punctured bicycle
on a hillside desolate
will nature make a man of me yet
when in this charming car
this charming man
why pamper life's complexity
on the passenger seat
i would go out tonight
but i haven't got a stitch to wear
this man said "it's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"
a jumped up pantry boy
who never knew his place
he said "return the ring"
he knows so much about these things
he knows so much about these things
i would go out tonight
but i haven't got a stitch to wear
this man said "it's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"
la la lala lala

golden brown texture like sun
lays me down with my might she runs
throughout the night no need to fight
never a frown with golden brown
every time just like the last
on her ship tied to the mast
to distant lands takes both my hands
never a frown with golden brown
golden brown finer temptress
through the ages she's heading west
from far away stays for a day
never a frown with golden brown

"bah humbug" no that's too strong
'cause it is my favorite holiday
but all this year's been a busy blur
don't think i have the energy
to add to my already mad rush
just 'cause it 'tis the season
the perfect gift for me would be
completions and connections left from
last year ski shop
encounter most interesting
had his number but never the time
most of passed along those lines
so deck those halls trim those trees
raise up cups of christmas cheer
i just need to catch my breath
christmas by myself this year
calendar picture frozen landscape
chilled this room for twentyfour days
evergreens sparkling snow
get this winter over with
flashback to springtime saw him again
would've been good to go for lunch
couldn't agree when we were both free
we tried we said we'd keep in touch
didn't of course 'til summertime
out to the beach to his boat could i join him
no this time it was me
sunburn in the third degree
now the calendar's just one page
and of course i am excited
tonight's the night i've set my mind
not to do too much about it
merry christmas merry christmas
but i think i'll miss this one this year
merry christmas merry christmas
but i think i'll miss this one this year
merry christmas merry christmas
but i think i'll miss this one this year
merry christmas merry christmas
but i think i'll miss this one this year
hardly dashing through the snow
'cause i bundled up too tight
last minute had to do
a few cards a few calls
because it's r s v p
no thanks no party lights
it's christmas eve gonna relax
turned down all of my invites
last fall i had a night to myself
same guy called halloween party
waited all night for him to show
this time his car wouldn't go
forget it it's cold it's getting late
trudge on home to celebrate
in a quiet way unwind
doing christmas right this time
ap has provided me
with the world's smallest turkey
already in the oven nice and hot
oh damn guess what i forgot
so on with the boots back out in the snow
to the only allnight grocery
when what to my wondering eyes should appear
in the line is that guy i've been chasing all year
"i'm spending this one alone" he said
"need a break this year's been crazy"
i said "me too but why are you
you mean you forgot cranberries too"
then suddenly we laughed and laughed
caught on to what was happening
that christmas magic's brought this tale
to a very happy ending
merry christmas merry christmas
couldn't miss this one this year
merry christmas merry christmas
couldn't miss this one this year
merry christmas merry christmas
couldn't miss this one this year
merry christmas merry christmas
couldn't miss this one this year
i wish i was a fisherman tumbling on the seas
far away from dry land and it's bitter memories
casting out my sweet line with abandonment and love
no ceiling bearing down on me save the starry sky above
with light in my head you in my arms woo woo ooh
i wish i was the brake man on a hurtlin' fevered train
crashing headlong into the heartland like a cannon in the rain
with the beating of the sleepers and the burning of the coal
counting towns flashing by me in a night that's full of soul
with light in my head you in my arms woo woo ooh
oh i know i will be loosened from bonds that hold me fast
and the chains all hung around me will fall away at last
and on that fine and fateful day i will take thee in my hands
i will ride on the train i will be the fisherman
with light in my head you in my arms woo woo ooh
light in my head you in my arms
light in my head you in my arms
light in my head you in my arms
children behave
that's what they say when we're together
and watch how you play
they don't understand and so we're
runnin' just as fast as we can
holdin' on to one another's hand
tryin' to get away into the night
and then you put your arms around me
and then you say
i think we're alone now
there doesn't seem to be anyone around
i think we're alone now
the beating of our hearts is the only sound
look at the way
we gotta hide what we're doing
'cause what would they say
if they ever knew and so we're
runnin' just as fast as we can
holdin' on to one another's hand
tryin' to get away into the night
and then you put your arms around me
and then you say
i think we're alone now
there doesn't seem to be anyone around
i think we're alone now
the beating of our hearts is the only sound
i think we're alone now
there doesn't seem to be anyone around
i think we're alone now
the beating of our hearts is the only sound
runnin' just as fast as we can
holdin' on to one another's hand
tryin' to get away into the night
and then you put your arms around me
and then you say
i think we're alone now
there doesn't seem to be anyone around
i think we're alone now
the beating of our hearts is the only sound
i think we're alone now
there doesn't seem to be anyone around
i think we're alone now
the beating of our hearts is the only sound

i call you when i need you my heart's on fire
you come to me come to me wild and wired
when you come to me
give me everything i need
give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
ohh it can't be wrong
take my heart and make it stronger baby
you're simply the best better than all the rest
better than anyone anyone i've ever met
i'm stuck on your heart i hang on every word you say
tear us apart baby i would rather be dead
in your heart i see the stars of every night and every day
just as long as i'm here in your arms
i could be in no better place
you're simply the best better than all the rest
better than anyone anyone i've ever met
i'm stuck on your heart i hang on every word you say
tear us apart baby i would rather be dead
each time you leave me i start losing control
you're walking away with my heart and my soul
i can feel you even when i'm alone
oh baby don't let go
you're the best better than all the rest
better than anyone anyone i've ever met
i'm stuck on your heart and hang on every word you say
tear us apart baby i would rather be dead
oh you're the best
you must understand though the touch of your hand
makes my pulse react
that it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
opposites attract
it's physical only logical
you must try to ignore that it means more than that
what's love got to do got to do with it
what's love but a second hand emotion
what's love got to do got to do with it
who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
it may seem to you that i'm acting confused
when you're close to me
if i tend to look dazed i've read it some place
i've got cause to be
there's a name for it
there's a phrase that fits
but whatever the reason you do it for me
what's love got to do got to do with it
what's love but a second hand emotion
what's love got to do got to do with it
who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
i've been taking on a new direction
but i have to say
i've been thinking about my own protection
it scares me to feel this way
what's love got to do got to do with it
what's love but a second hand emotion
what's love got to do got to do with it
who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
what's love got to do got to do with it
what's love but a sweet oldfashioned notion
what's love got to do got to do with it
who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
what's love oooh got to do with it
what's love but a second hand emotion
what's love got to do got to do with it
who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

oh baby don't it feel like heaven right now
don't it feel like somethin' from a dream
yeah i've never known nothing quite like this
don't it feel like tonight might never be again
we know better than to try and pretend
baby no one could have ever told me 'bout this
i said "hey yeah" "heyee yeahee yeahee yeah"
the waiting is the hardest part
every day you see one more card
you take it on faith you take it to the heart
the waiting is the hardest part
well yeah i might have chased a couple of women around
all it ever got me was down
then there were those that made me feel good
but never as good as i feel right now
baby you're the only one that's ever known how
to make me wanna live like i wanna live now
i said "hey yeah" "heyee yeahee yeahee yeah"
the waiting is the hardest part
every day you get one more yard
you take it on faith you take it to the heart
the waiting is the hardest part
don't let it kill you baby don't let it get to you
don't let em kill you baby don't let em get to you
i'll be your bleedin' heart i'll be your cryin' fool
don't let this go too far don't let it get to you
i said "hey yeah" "heyee yeahee yeahee yeah"
the waiting is the hardest part
every day you get one more yard
you take it on faith you take it to the heart
the waiting is the hardest part
the waiting is the hardest
part

outside another yellow moon
has punched a hole in the nighttime yes
i climb through the window and down to the street
i'm shining like a new dime
the downtown trains are full
with all of those brooklyn girls
they try so hard to break out of their little worlds
well you wave your hand and they scatter like crows
they have nothing that will ever capture your heart
they're just thorns without the rose
be careful of them in the dark
oh if i was the one you chose to be your only one
oh baby can't you hear me now can't you hear me now
will i see you tonight
on a downtown train
every night it's just the same you leave me lonely now
i know your window and i know it's late
i know your stairs and your doorway
i walk down your street and past your gate
i stand by the light at the fourway
you watch them as they fall
oh baby they all have heartattacks
they stay at the carnival but they'll never win you back
will i see you tonight
on a downtown train
where every night every night it's just the same oh baby
will i see you tonight
on a downtown train
all of my dreams they fall like rain oh baby on a downtown train
will i see you tonight
on a downtown train
where every night every night it's just the same oh baby
will i see you tonight
on a downtown train
all of my dreams they fall like rain oh baby on a downtown train
all on a downtown train all on a downtown train
all on a downtown train a downtown train

the smart money's on harlow
and the moon is in the street
the shadow boys are breaking all the laws
and you're east of east saint louis
and the wind is making speeches
and the rain sounds like a round of applause
napoleon is weeping
in the carnival saloon
his invisible fiance's in the mirror
and the band is going home
it's raining hammers it's raining nails
it's true there's nothing left for him down here
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
and it's time time time that you love
and it's time time time
and they all pretend they're orphans
and their memory's like a train
you can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
and the things you can't remember
tell the things you can't forget
that history puts a saint in every dream
well she said she'd stick around
until the bandages came off
but these mama's boys just don't know when to quit
and matilda asks the sailors
are those dreams or are those prayers
so close your eys son and this won't hurt a bit
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
and it's time time time that you love
and it's time time time
well things are pretty lousy
for a calendar girl
the boys just dive right off the cars and splash into the street
and when they're on a roll
she pulls a razor from her boot
and a thousand pigeons fall around her feet
so put a candle in the window
and a kiss upon his lips
as the dish outside the window fills with rain
just like a stranger
with the weeds in your heart
and pay the fiddler off 'till i come back again
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
and it's time time time that you love
and it's time time time

i hear the drums echoing tonight
she hears only whispers of some quiet conversa tion
she's coming in twelve thirty flight
the moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me toward salvation
i stopped an old man along the way
hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
he turned to me as if to say “hurry boy it's waiting there for you”
gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had
ooo ooo
the wild dogs cry out in the night
as they grow restless longing for some solitary company
i know that i must do what's right
as sure as kilimanjaro rises like olympus above the serengeti
i seek to cure what's deep inside
frightened of this thing that i've become
it’s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had
ooo ooo
“hurry boy she's waiting there for you”
it’s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had…

maybe together we can get somewhere
any place is better
starting from zero got nothing to lose
maybe we'll make something
me myself i got nothing to prove
you got a fast car
i got a plan to get us out of here
i been working at the convenience store
managed to save just a little bit of money
won't have to drive too far
just 'cross the border and into the city
you and i can both get jobs
and finally see what it means to be living
you see my old man's got a problem
he live with the bottle that’s the way it is
he says his body's too old for working
his body's too young to look like his
my mama went off and left him she wanted more from life than he could give
i said "somebody's got to take care of him"
so i quit school and that's what i did
you got a fast car
but is it fast enough so we can fly away
we gotta make a decision
leave tonight or live and die this way
so i remember when we were driving driving in your car
the speed so fast i felt like i was drunk
city lights lay out before us
and your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
and i had a feeling that i belonged
and i had a feeling i could be someone be someone be someone
you got a fast car
and we go cruising to entertain ourselves
you still ain't got a job
and i work in a market as a checkout girl
i know things will get better
you'll find work and i'll get promoted
we'll move out of the shelter
buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
so i remember when we were driving driving in your car
the speed so fast i felt like i was drunk
city lights lay out before us
and your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
and i had a feeling that i belonged
and i had a feeling i could be someone be someone be someone
you got a fast car
and i got a job that pays all our bills
you stay out drinking late at the bar
you see more your friends than you do your kids
i'd always hoped for better
thought maybe together you and me would find it
i got no plans i ain't going nowhere
so take your fast car and keep on driving
so i remember when we were driving driving in your car
the speed so fast i felt like i was drunk
city lights lay out before us
and your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
and i had a feeling that i belonged
and i had a feeling i could be someone be someone be someone
you got a fast car
but is it fast enough so you can fly away
you gotta make a decision
leave tonight or live and die this way

well it's all right sometimes you gotta be strong
well it's all right as long as you got somewhere to lay
well it's all right every day is judgement day

you'll think of me and wonder where i am these days
maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays
purple haze
well it's all right even when push comes to shove
well it's all right if you got someone to love
well it's all right everything'll work out fine
well it's all right we're going to the end of the line

in banbridge town in the county down
one morning last july
from a boreen green came a sweet colleen
and she smiled as she passed me by
she looked so sweet from her two bare feet
to the sheen of her nut brown hair
such a coaxing elf sure i shook my self
for to see i was really there
from bantry bay up to derry quay and
from galway to dublin town
no maid i've seen like the brown colleen
that i met in the county down
as she onward sped sure i scratched my head
and i looked with a feelin' rare
and i says says i to a passerby
"who's the maid with the nut brown hair"
he smiled at me and he says says he
"that's the gem of ireland's crown
young rosie mccann from the banks of the bann
she's the star of the county down"
from bantry bay up to derry quay and
from galway to dublin town
no maid i've seen like the brown colleen
that i met in the county down
at the harvest fair she'll be surely there
and i'll dress in my sunday clothes
with my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right
for a smile from my nut brown rose
no pipe i'll smoke no horse i'll yoke
till my plough turns rust coloured brown
till a smiling bride by my own fireside
sits the star of the county down
from bantry bay up to derry quay and
from galway to dublin town
no maid i've seen like the brown colleen
that i met in the county down

their favorite time of the year
snowflakes in the air
carols everywhere
olden times and ancient rhymes
of love and dreams to share
sleigh bells in the air
beauty everywhere
yuletide by the fireside
and joyful memories there
christmas time is here
we'll be drawing near
oh that we could always see
such spirit through the year
sleigh bells in the air
beauty everywhere
yuletide by the fireside
and joyful memories there
christmas time is here
we'll be drawing near
oh that we could always see
such spirit through the year

the only two things in life that make it worth livin'
is guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women
i don't need my name in the marquee lights
i got my song and i got you with me to night
maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
let's go to luckenbach texas
with waylon and willie and the boys
this successful life we're livin's got us
feudin' like the hatfields and mccoys
and blue eyes cryin in the rain
out in luckenbach texas
ain't nobody feelin' no pain
so baby let's sell your diamond ring
buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
in your high society you cry all day
fourcar garage and we're still buildin' on
maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
let's go to luckenbach texas
with waylon and willie and the boys
this successful life we're livin's got us
feudin' like the hatfields and mccoys
and blue eyes cryin in the rain

crowded room friends with tired eyes
hiding from you and your soul of ice

me i guess i was a shoulder to cry on
a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a man undercover but you tore him apart
oohhoo

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special

little child dry your cryin eyes
how can i explain the fear you feel inside
because you were born into this evil world
where man is killing man and no one knows just why
what have we become just look what we have done
all that we’ve destroyed you must build again
when the children cry let em know we tried
because when the children sing then the new world begins
little child you must show the way
to a better day for all the young
because you were born for all the world to see
that we all can live with love and peace
no more presidents and all the wars will end
one united world under god
when the children cry let em know we tried
because when the children sing then the new world begins
what have we become just look what we have done
all that we’ve destroyed you must build again
no more presidents and all the wars will end
one united world under god
when the children cry let em know we tried
when the children fight let em know it ain’t right
when the children pray let em know the way
because when the children sing then the new world begins
i don't know where i'm going
but i sure know where i've been
hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday
and i've made up my mind
i ain't wasting no more time
here i go again
here i go again
though i keep searching for an answer
i never seem to find what i'm looking for
oh lord i pray you give me strength to carry on
'cause i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams
and here i go again on my own
going down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
and i've made up my mind
i ain't wasting no more time
i'm just another heart in need of rescue
waiting on love's sweet charity
and i'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days
'cause i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams
and here i go again on my own
going down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
and i've made up my mind
i ain't wasting no more time
but here i go again here i go again
here i go again here i go
'cause i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams
and here i go again on my own
going down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
and i've made up my mind
i ain't wasting no more time
and here i go again on my own
going down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
'cause i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams
and here i go again on my own
going down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
i believe the children are our future
teach them well and let them lead the way
show them all the beauty they posses inside
give them a sense of pride to make it easier
let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
everybody seaching for a hero
people need someone to look up to
i never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
a lonely place to be so i learned to depend on me
i decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
if i failed if i succeed at least i lived as i believed
no matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity
because the greatest love of all is happening to me
i found the greatest love of all inside of me
the greatest love of all
is easy to achieve learning to love yourself
it is the greatest love of all
i believe the children are our future
teach them well and let them lead the way
show them all the beauty they posses inside
give them a sense of pride to make it easier
let the children's laughter remind us how we used to
be
i decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
if i failed if i succeed at least i lived as i believed
no matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity
because the greatest love of all is happening to me
i found the greatest love of all inside of me
the greatest love of all
is easy to achieve learning to love yourself
it is the greatest love of
all
and if by chance that special place that you've been dreaming of
leads you to a lonely place find your strength in love
there's a boy i know
he's the one i dream of
looks into my eyes
takes me to the clouds above
ooh i lose control
can't seem to get enough
when i wake from dreaming
tell me is it really love
how will i know
girl trust your feelings
how will i know
how will i know
love can be deceiving
how will i know
how will i know if he really loves me
i say a prayer with every heart beat
i fall in love whenever we meet
i'm asking you cause you know about these things
how will i know if he's thinking of me
i try to phone but i'm too shy can't speak
falling in love is so bitter sweet
this love is strong why do i feel weak
oh wake me i'm shaking

what i feel is really love
ooh tell me how will i know

clocks strikes upon the hour and the sun begins to fade
still enough time to figure out how to chase my blues away
i've done alright up 'til now it's the light of day that shows me how
and when the night falls loneliness calls
oh i wanna dance with somebody
yeah i wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me
oh i wanna dance with somebody
yeah i wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me
i've been in love and lost my senses spinning through the town
soon or later the fever ends and i wind up feeling down
i need a man who'll take a chance
on a love that burns hot enough to last
so when the night falls my lonely heart calls
oh i wanna dance with somebody
yeah i wanna dance with somebody

with somebody who loves me
somebody who somebody who somebody to love me

each day i live i want to be
a day to give the best of me

my finest day is yet unknown
i broke my heart for every gain
to taste the sweet i faced the pain
i rise and fall yet through it all
this must remains
i want one moment in time
when i'm more than i thought i could be
when all of my dreams are a heart beat away
and the answers are all up to me
give me one moment in time
when i'm racing with destiny
then in that one moment of time
i will feel i will feel eternity
i've lived to be the very best
i want it all no time for less

here in my hands
give me one moment in time

then in that one moment of time
i will be i will be i will be free

a few stolen moments is all that we share
you've got your family and they need you there
though i try to resist being last on your list
but no other man's gonna do
so i'm saving all my love for you
it's not very easy living alone
my friends try and tell me find a man of my own
but each time i try i just break down and cry
'cause i'd rather be home feeling blue
so i'm saving all my love for you
you used to tell me we'd run away together
love gives you the right to be free
you said be patient just wait a little longer
but that's just an old fantasy
i've got to get ready just a few minutes more
gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
we'll be making love the whole night through
so i'm saving all my love

'cause tonight is the night that i'm feeling alright
we'll be making love the whole night through
so i'm saving all my love
yeah i'm saving all my loving
darlin' yes i'm saving all my love for you
for you

e||| h = hammer on
livin' on the road my friend
was gonna keep you free and clean
and now you wear your skin like iron
and your breath's as hard as kerosene
weren't your mama's only boy
but her favorite one it seems
she began to cry when you said goodbye
and sank into your dreams
pancho was a bandit boys
his horse was fast as polished steel
he wore his gun outside his pants
for all the honest world to feel
well pancho met his match you know
on the deserts down in mexico
nobody heard his dyin' words
ah but that's the way it goes
all the federales say
they could have had him any day
they only let him slip away
out of kindness i suppose
lefty he can't sing the blues
all night long like he used to
the dust that pancho bit down south
ended up in lefty's mouth
the day they laid poor pancho low
lefty split for ohio
where he got the bread to go
there ain't nobody knows
all the federales say
they could have had him any day
we only let him slip away
out of kindness i suppose
the poets tell how pancho fell
and lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
the desert's quiet and cleveland's cold
and so the story ends we're told
pancho needs your prayers it's true
but save a few for lefty too
he only did what he had to do
and now he's growin' old
all the federales say
they could have had him any day
they only let him go so long
out of kindness i suppose
a few gray federales say
they could have had him any day
they only let him go so long
out of kindness i suppose

von dir keine spur die wohnung ist leer
und mein herz wie blei so schwer
ich geh' kaputt und du bist wieder bei ihm
ich weiss nur eins jetzt ist schluss
und dass ich um dich kämpfen muss
wo bist du sag mir wo bist du
wahnsinn warum schickst du mich in die hölle
eiskalt lässt du meine seele erfrier'n
das ist wahnsinn du spielst mit
meinen gefühlen
und mein stolz liegt längst schon auf dem müll
doch noch weiss ich was ich will ich will dich
ich lauf im kreis von früh bis spät
denn ich weiß dass ohne dich nichts geht
ich brauche luft bevor mein herz erstickt
und wie ein wolf renn´ ich durch die stadt
such hungrig uns´re kneipen ab
wo bist du sag mir wo bist du
looking from a window above
it's like a story of love
can you hear me
came back only yesterday
i'm moving farther away
want you near me
all i needed was the love you gave
all i needed for another day
and all i ever knew
only you
sometimes when i think of her name
when it's only a game
and i need you
listening to the words that you say
it's getting harder to stay
when i see you
all i needed was the love you gave
all i needed for another day
and all i ever knew
only you
this is gonna take a long time
and i wonder what's mine
can't take no more
wonder if you'll understand
it's just the touch of your hand
behind a closed door
all i needed was the love you gave
all i needed for another day
and all i ever knew
only you
only you
het was kerstochtend ik weet 't nog zo goed mijn konijnenhok was leeg
en moeder zei dat ik niet in de schuur mocht komen
en als ik lief ging spelen dat ik dan wat lekkers kreeg
zij wist ook niet waar flappie uit kon hangen
ze zou 't pappa vragen maar omdat die bezig was
in het fietsenschuurtje moest ik maar een uurtje goed naar flappie zoeken
hij liep vast wel ergens op 't gras
maar ik had 't hok toch goed dichtgedaan zoals ik dat elke avond deed
ik weet ook niet waarom ik dat deed
'k had heel lang voor 't hok gestaan alsof ik wist wat ik nu weet
het was eerste kerstdag wij naar flappie zoeken
vader die zocht gewoon mee
bij de bomen en 't water maar niet in dat fietsenschuurtje
want daar kon ie toch niet zitten en ik schudde nee
we zochten samen samen tot de koffie
de familie aan de koffie maar ik hoefde niet
ik dacht aan flappie en dat 't 's nachts zo koud kon vriezen
m'n hoofdje stil gebogen dikke tranen van verdriet
het was eerste kerstdag
er werd luidruchtig gegeten maar dat deed me niet zoveel
ik dacht aan flappie m'n eigen kleine flappie
waar zou die lopen geen hap ging door m'n keel
toen na de soep het hoofdgerecht zou komen sprak m’n vader uiterst grappig
"kijk youp daar is flappy dan"
ik zie de zilv'ren schaal nog en daar lag 'ie in drie stukken
voor 't eerst zag ik m'n vader als 'n vreselijke man
en ik ben gillend en stampend naar bed gegaan
heb eerst een uur liggen huilen op de sprei
"flappy was van mij"
'k heb heel lang voor 't raam gestaan maar 't hok stond er maar verlaten bij
het was tweede kerstdag moeder weet 't nog zo goed vaders bed was leeg
en ik zei dat zij niet in de schuur mocht komen
en als ze lief ging spelen dat ze dan wat lekkers kreeg
clean shirt new shoes
and i don't know where i am goin' to
silk suit black tie
i don't need a reason why
they come runnin' just as fast as they can
coz every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
gold watch diamond ring
i ain't missin' not a single thing
and cufflinks stick pin
when i step out i'm gonna do you in
they come runnin' just as fast as they can
coz every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
top coat top hat
i don't worry coz my wallet's fat
black shades white gloves
lookin' sharp and lookin' for love
they come runnin' just as fast as they can
coz every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
fade out
