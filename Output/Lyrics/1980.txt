jag är en lugn person med takt och ton måttfull och balanserad
jag är tyst och still och det ska mycket till innan jag blir exalterad
men jag har en last som håller mig fast ett järngrepp varje vinter
när året är slut och snön ligger djup och slädarnas medar slinter
jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul
tusen stjärnor som tindrar glitter så långt jag ser
av juleljus som glimmar vill jag ha mer
en show glöms bort om den bara visar opp effekter som man knappast anar
så ge mig trettio grader kallt tomtar överallt och en skog av gröna granar
jag vill ha snötyngda hus tusentals ljus kulörta kulor drivor
bjällerklang som ackompanjemang på alla julens skivor
jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul
tusen stjärnor som tindrar glitter så långt jag ser
av juleljus som glimmar vill jag ha mer
ge mig en svårknäckt nöt sötare gröt djupare dopp grytan
glittrigare glim och grötigare rim och mer arne weise rutan
jag vill ha rymligare säck segare knäck fetare fläsk från grisen
krimsigare krams längre långdans och raskare räv på isen
jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul jag vill ha mer jul ge mig mer jul
tusen stjärnor som tindrar glitter så långt jag ser
av juleljus som glimmar vill jag ha mer
jag vill ha mer mer ge mig mer mer
jag vill ha mer mer ge mig mer mer fade out

comme elle est partie jim les nerfs
jimmy boit du gin dans sa chrysler
la presqu'île le boulevard de la mer est con
comme elle est partie attention jimmy tourne en rond

elle était son calmant son alcool profond
comme elle est partie attention jimmy tourne pas rond
jimmy t'es fort mais tu pleures sur le cuir de ta chrysler

il sent son parfum sur la corniche
les lacets le gravier et dans l'air du soir
la chrysler s'envole dans les fougères et les nénuphars
jimmy s'éveille dans l'air idéal
le paradis clair d'une chambre d'hôpital
l'infirmière est un ange et ses yeux sont verts
comme elle lui sourit attention jimmy veut lui plaire

on endless ocean finally lovers know shame
turning returning secret place inside
watching slow motion turn around say
take breath away

watching i keep waiting still anticipating love
never hesitating become fated ones
turning returning secret place hide
watching slow motion turn say love
take breath away
take breath away
through hourglass i saw in time slipped away
when mirror crashed i called turned hear say
if today i unafraid
take breath away
take breath away
watching every motion foolish lover's game
haunted notion somewhere love flames
turning returning secret place inside
watching slow motion turn way say love
take breath away
take breath away
it must cold shadow
never sunlight face
you content let shine way
you always walked step behind
so i one glory
one strain
a beautiful face without name long
a beautiful smile hide pain

who's gonna make first mistake
who wants wear gypsy leathers
way fire lake
who wants break news uncle joe
you remember uncle joe one afraid cut cake
who wants tell poor aunt sarah
joe's run fire lake
joe's run fire lake
who wants brave bronze beauties lying sun
long soft hair fallin' flyin' run
oh smile shy flirt well
lay fast till look straight say
oh lord i really last
wants play eights aces
who wants raise needs stake
who wants take long shot gamble
head fire lake
and head fire lake varying lyrics
stood boldly sweatin' sun
felt million felt number one
the height summer i'd never felt strong
like rock
i eighteen care

my hands steady eyes clear bright
my walk purpose steps quick light
and i held firm i felt right
like rock
like rock i strong i
like rock nothin' got
like rock i something see
like rock
and i stood arrow straight unencumbered weight
of hustlers schemes
i stood proud i stood tall high
i still believed dreams
twenty years now where'd go
twenty years i know
i sit i wonder sometimes
gone
and sometimes late night
oh i'm bathed firelight
the moon comes callin' ghostly white
and i recall i recall
like rock standin' arrow straight
like rock chargin' gate
like rock carryin' weight
like rock
like rock sun upon skin
like rock hard wind
like rock i see
like rock
moving next chord

when nothin comes easy
old nightmares real
until ve beside man

where angels fear tread
some men go crazy
some men go slow
some men go want
some men never go

comfort crowd
strangers faces around
laughin right loud
hey watch goin
step light old toes
cause youve beside man

never easy try
sometimes happiness captured
somehow time place stand still
love lives inside hearts
and always will

maybe memories sweet
but know bad times
or lives incomplete
then shadows overtake us
just feel hope gone
we’ll hear song know
our love lives
how moment last forever
how happiness endure
through darkest troubles
love beauty love pure
love pays mind desolation
it flows river soul
protects persists perseveres
and makes us whole
minutes turn hours
days years gone
but forgotten
still song lives
that's moment lasts forever
when song lives

the kids driving saturday afternoon passed
i'm savouring familiar sights
we shared history town i
and i stop longforgotten feeling
in time book room stay tonight
number find friends say "you're well
after time boys look same"
number happy hour one two hotels
and settle play "do remember soandso"
number never say name
and oh flame trees'll blind weary driver
and nothing set fire town
there's change pace everything within place
just makes harder believe around
oh needs sentimental bullshit anyway
it takes memory make cry
and i'm happy sit table old friends
and see one us tell biggest lies
and girl fallin' love near pianola stands
with young local factory auto worker holdin' hands
and i'm wondering go stay
do remember nothing stopped us field day
and oh flame trees'll blind weary driver
and nothing set fire town
there's change pace everything within place
just makes harder believe around
and oh flame trees'll blind weary driver
and nothing set fire town
there's change pace everything within place
just makes harder believe around
ain't nobody gonna steal heart away
ain't nobody gonna steal heart away
when war got away
pack bag place time day
you i used other's shoulder
still young somehow much older
how i go home blown away
e||
e||
e||
e||
you i sights set something
hope mean days numbered
i've got plans wanted man
all around chaos madness
can't help feeling nothing sadness
only choice face best i
when war got start
try hold trace back
you i sent stories
just page i'm lost glory
how i go home blown away
ain't nobody gonna steal heart away
ain't nobody gonna steal heart away
ain't nobody gonna steal heart away

ain't nobody gonna steal heart away
ain't nobody gonna steal heart away

got outta town boat southern islands
sailing reach following sea
she making trades outside
and downhill run papeete bay
off wind heading lie marqueses
we got eighty feet waterline nicely making way
in noisy bar avalon i tried call
but midnight watch i realized twice ran away
think
think many times i fallen
spirits using larger voices calling
what heaven brought forgotten
i around world
looking woman girl
who knows love endure
and know will
and know will
when see southern cross first time
you understand now came way
cause truth might runnin' small
but big promise
the promise coming day
so i'm sailing tommorrow dreams dying
and love anchor tied
tied silver chain
i ship flags flying
she i left
and music name
think
think many times i fallen
spirits using larger voices calling
what heaven brought forgotten
i around world
looking woman girl
who knows love endure
and know will
and know will
so cheated lied tested
and never failed fail
it easiest thing
you will survive bested
somebody fine will come along
make forget loving
somewhere deep inside
something's got hold
and pushing aside
see stretch forever
and i know i'm right
for first time life
that's i tell
you'd better home soon
stripping back coats
of lies deception
back nothingness
like week desert
and i know i'm right
for first time life
that's i tell
you'd better home soon
so say say nothing's wrong
cos back home maybe i'll gone
it cause pain
if end
but i start
you depend
and i know i'm right
for first time life
that's i tell
you'd better home soon
that's i tell
you'd better home soon

met old lover grocery store
the snow falling christmas eve
i stole behind frozen foods
and i touched sleeve
she recognize face first
but eyes flew open wide
she went hug spilled purse
and laughed cried
we took groceries checkout stand
the food totaled bagged
we stood lost embarrassment
as conversation dragged
went drink two
but find open bar
we bought sixpack liquor store
and drank car
we drank toast innocence
we drank toast now
tried reach beyond emptiness
but neither one knew
she said married architect
who kept warm safe dry
she liked say loved man
but want lie
i said years friend
and eyes still blue
but eyes i sure i
saw doubt gratitude
she said saw record stores
and i must well
i said audience heavenly
but travelling hell
we drank toast innocence
we drank toast now
tried reach beyond emptiness
but neither one knew
we drank toast innocence
we drank toast time
reliving eloquence
another "auld lang syne"
the beer empty tongues tired
and running things say
she gave kiss i got
and i watched drive away
just moment i back school
and felt old familiar pain
and i turned make way back home
the snow turned rain
true love will find end
find friend
sad know will
dont give
true love will find end
promise catch
looking find
cause true love searching
recognise
unless step light light
sad know will
give true love will find end
there's sad love
deep eyes kind pale jewel
open closed within eyes
i'll place sky within eyes
there's fooled heart
beating fast search new dreams
a love will last within heart
i'll place moon within heart
as pain sweeps
makes sense
every thrill gone
wasn't much fun
but i'll youoooo
as world falls
falling
as world falling
falling love
i'll paint mornings gold
i'll spin valentine evenings
though strangers till now
we're choosing path stars
i'll lay love stars
as pain sweeps
makes sense
every thrill gone
wasn't much fun
but i'll youoooo
as world falls
do remember guy
in early song
i've heard rumour ground control
oh say true
they got message action man
i'm happy hope happy
i've loved i've needed love
sordid details following
the shrieking nothing killing
just pictures jap girls synthesis i
ain't got money i ain't got hair
but i'm hoping kick planet glowing
ashes ashes funk funky
we know major tom's junkie
strung heaven's high
hitting alltime low
time i tell
i'll stay clean tonight
but little green wheels following
oh

i'm happy hope happy
one flash light smoking pistol
i've never done good things
i've never done bad things

we know major tom's junkie
strung heaven's high

on croyait savoir tout sur l'amour depuis toujours
dans le velours
et puis te voilà bout de femme comme
soufflée d'une sarbacane
le ciel même un autre éclat depuis toi
les hommes poursuivent ce temps qui court
depuis toujours
sur mon parcours
pendue à mon cou comme une liane
comm'le roseau d'la sarbacane
le ciel s'est ouvert par endroit depuis toi
pas besoin de phrases ni de longs discours
ça change tout dedans
ça change tout autour
finis les matins paupières en panne
lourdes comme les bouteilles de butane
j'ai presque plus ma tête à moi
depuis toi
pas besoin de faire de trop longs discours
ça change tout de dans ça change tout au tour
pourvu que jamais tu ne t'éloignes
plus loin qu'un jet de sarbacane
j'ai presque plus ma tête à moi
depuis toi
alors te voilà bout de femme
comme soufflée d'une sarbacane
le ciel s`est ouvert par endroit
depuis toi
oh depuis toi

estoy llorando en mi habitación
todo se nubla mi alrededor
y un jersey amarillo
por el parque los veo pasar
cuando se besan lo paso fatal
voy llenarle el cuello
de polvos pica pica
sufre mamón
devuélveme mi chica
o te retorcerás
entre polvos picapica
le quemamos su jersey
se ha comprado cinco o seis
lo tengo preparado
voy esta noche
no te reirás nunca mas de mi
lo siento nene vas morir
y volverá conmigo
volverá algún día
we're walking air
we're floating moonlit sky
the people far sleeping fly
i'm holding tight
i'm riding midnight blue
i'm finding i fly high
far across world
the villages go dreams
the rivers hills
the forests streams
children gaze openmouthed
taken surprise
nobody believes eyes
we're surfing air
we're swimming frozen sky
we're drifting icy
mountains floating
suddenly swooping low
on ocean deep
rousing mighty monster sleep
we're walking air
we're dancing midnight sky
and everyone sees us greets us fly
the power love curious thing
make one man weep make another man sing
change hawk little white dove
feeling power love
you need money take fame
don't need credit card ride train
it's strong sudden cruel sometimes
might save life
that's power love
that's power love
they say love fair
yeah care
but know
gets hold
little help
feel power love
feel power love
can feel
hmmm
feel nothin' till feel
feel power power love
that's power power love

elle avait les yeux clairs et la robe en velours
a côté de sa mère et la famille autour
elle pose un peu distraite au doux soleil de la fin du jour
la photo n'est pas bonne mais l'on peut y voir
le bonheur en personne et la douceur d'un soir
elle aimait la musique surtout schumann et puis mozart
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi que je regarde tout bas
comme toi qui dors en rêvant à quoi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
elle allait à l'école au village d'en bas
elle apprenait les livres elle apprenait les lois
elle chantait les grenouilles et les princesses qui dorment au bois
elle aimait sa poupée elle aimait ses amis
surtout ruth et anna et surtout jérémy
et ils se marieraient un jour peutêtre à varsovie
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi que je regarde tout bas
comme toi qui dors en rêvant à quoi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
elle s'appelait sarah elle n'avait pas huit ans
sa vie c'était douceur rêves et nuages blancs
mais d'autres gens en avaient décidé autrement
elle avait tes yeux clairs et elle avait ton âge
c'était une petite fille sans histoire et très sage
mais elle n'est pas née comme toi ici et maintenant
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi
comme toi que je regarde tout bas
comme toi qui dors en rêvant à quoi
comme toi comme toi comme toi comme toi


i give voice bred rhythm soul
the heart welsh boy lost home
put harmony let words ring
carry thoughts songs sing
je te donne mes notes je te donne mes mots
quand ta voix les emporte à ton propre tempo
une épaule fragile et solide à la fois
ce que j'imagine et ce que je crois
je te donne toutes mes différences
tous ces défauts qui sont autant de chances
on sera jamais des 'standards' des gens bien comme il faut
je te donne ce que j'ai ce que je vaux
i give force
of ancestral pride
the will go i'm hurt deep inside
whatever feeling whatever way
it helps go day day
je te donne nos doutes et notre indicible espoir
les questions que les routes ont laissées dans l'histoire
nos filles sont brunes et l'on parle un peu fort
et l'humour et l'amour sont nos trésors
je te donne toutes mes différences
tous ces défauts qui sont autant de chances
on sera jamais des 'standards' des gens bien comme il faut
je te donne ce que j'ai ce que je vaux
je te donne donne donne ce que je suis
i give voice bred rhythm soul
je te donne mes notes je te donne ma voix
the songs i love stories i've told
ce que j'imagine et ce que je crois
i make feel good even i'm
les raisons qui portent et ce stupide espoir
my force platform climb
une épaule fragile et forte à la fois
je te donne houuu je te donne
tout ce que je vaux ce que je suis mes dons mes défauts
mes plus belles chances mes différences
je te donne
puisque l'ombre gagne
puisqu'il n'est pas de montagne
audela des vents plus haute que les marches de l'oubli
puisqu'il faut apprendre
a defaut de le comprendre
a rever nos desirs et vivre des ainsi soitils
et puisque tu penses
comme une intime evidence
que parfois meme tout donner n'est pas forcement suffire
puisque c'est ailleurs
qu'ira mieux battre ton coeur
et puisque nous t'aimons trop pour te retenir
puisque tu pars
que les vents te menent ou d'autres ames plus belles
sauront t'aimer mieux que nous puisque l'on ne peut t'aimer plus
que la vie t'apprenne
mais que tu restes le meme
si tu te trahissais nous t'aurions tout fait perdu
garde cette chance que nous t'envions en silence
cette force de penser que le plus beau reste venir
et loin de nos villes
comme octobre l'est d'avril
sache qu'ici reste de toi comme une empreinte indelebile
sans drame sans larmes
pauvres et derisoires armes
parce qu'il est des douleurs qui ne pleurent qu'a l'interieur
puisque ta maison
aujourd'hui c'est l'horizon
dans ton exil essaie d'apprendre revenir
mais pas trop tard
dans ton histoire
garde en memoire
notre au revoir
puisque tu pars
j'aurais pu fermer oublier toutes ces portes
tout quitter sur un simple geste mais tu ne l'as pas fait
j'aurais pu donner tant d'amour et tant de force
mais tout ce que je pouvais ça n'etait pas encore assez
pas assez pas assez pas assez

ni una simple sonrisa ni un poco de luz
en sus ojos profundos
ni siquiera reflejo de algún pensamiento
que alegre su mundo
hay tristeza en sus ojos hablando y callando
y bailando conmigo una pena lejana
que llega mi alma y se hace cariño
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
vive solo y necesita amor
como el aire necesita verme
como al sol lo necesito yo
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
ha encontrado aquí una razón
para hacer que su mirada ría
con mis besos y mi gran amor
ni su nombre conozco y ya quiero volver
encontrarlo solas
y en sus ojos de otoño dormir poco poco
olvidando las horas
yo pretendo saber por qué extraña razón
hoy sus ojos ríen yo pretendo lograr
con ternura y amor ver sus ojos felices
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
vive solo y necesita amor
como el aire necesita verme
como al sol lo necesito yo
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
ha encontrado aquí una razón
para hacer que su mirada ría
con mis besos y mi gran amor
el muchacho de los ojos tristes
vive solo y necesita amor
como el aire necesita verme
como al sol lo necesito yo

just small town girl living lonely world
she took midnight train going anywhere
just city boy born raised south detroit
he took midnight train going anywhere
a singer smoky room smell wine cheap perfume
for smile share night goes
strangers waiting boulevard
their shadows searching night
streetlight people living find emotion
hiding somewhere night
working hard fill everybody wants thrill
paying anything roll dice one time
some will win will lose born sing blues
oh movie never ends goes
strangers waiting boulevard
their shadows searching night
streetlight people living find emotion
hiding somewhere night
don't stop believing hold feeling
streetlight people
don't stop believing hold feeling
streetlight people
don't stop believing hold feeling
streetlight people
highway run midnight sun
wheels go round round mind
restless hearts sleep alone tonight
sending love along wire
they say road ain't place start family
right line
and lovin' music man ain't always supposed
oh oh girl stand
i'm forever faithfully
circus life big top world
we need clowns make us smile
through space time always another show
wondering i lost without
and apart ain't easy love affair
two strangers learn fall love
i joy rediscovering
oh oh girl stand

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
faithfully i'm still

lying beside dark feeling heartbeat mine
softly whisper you're sincere how love blind
we sailed together drifted apart side
so now i come open arms nothing hide believe i say
so i open arms hoping see love means
open arms
living without living alone this empty house seems cold
wanting hold you wanting near how much i wanted home
but now come back turned night day i need say
so now i come open arms nothing hide believe i say
so i open arms hoping see love means
open arms
here stand
worlds apart hearts broken two two two
sleepless nights
losing ground
i'm reaching
feelin' gone
can change mind
if go
to survive tide love divides
someday love will find
break chains bind
one night will remind
how touched
and went separate ways
if hurts
true love desert
you know i still love
though touched
and went separate ways
troubled times
caught confusions pain pain pain
distant eyes
promises made vain vain vain
if must go i wish love
you'll never walk alone
take care love
miss love
someday love will find
break chains bind
one night will remind
how touched
and went separate ways
if hurts
true love desert
you know i still love
though touched
and went separate ways
someday love will find
break chains bind
one night will remind
if hurts
true love desert
you know i still love
i still love girl
i really love girl
and hurts
true love desert
nooooooooooooo
nooooooooooooo
when routine bites hard
and ambitions low
and resentment rides high
but emotions grow
and changing ways
taking different roads
then love love will tear us apart
love love will tear us apart
why bedroom cold
turned away side
is timing flawed
our respect run dry
yet still appeal
that kept lives
and love love will tear us apart
love love will tear us apart
do cry sleep
all failings exposed
get taste mouth
as desperation takes hold
is something good
just function
when love love will tear us apart
love love will tear us apart
love love will tear us apart
love love will tear us apart

there'll strings bind hands
not love bind heart
there's need take stand
for i chose start
i see need take home
i'm old enough face dawn
just call angel morning angel
just touch cheek leave baby
just call angel morning angel
then slowly turn away
maybe sun's light will dim
and matter anyhow
if morning's echo says sinned
well i wanted now
and victims night
i blinded light
just call angel morning angel
just touch cheek leave baby
just call angel morning angel
then slowly turn away
i beg stay

through tears
day
of years baaaby
just call angel morning angel
just touch cheek leave baby
just call angel morning angel
just touch cheek leave darlin'
just call angel morning angel
just touch cheek leave darrlin'
on pohjantähden alla tää koti mulla mainen
mä elämästä laulan olen suomalainen
oi jospa tietäisivät maailmalla
aikaan saisi aika monta valtamerta
on täällä monta yksinäistä
eikä ikävoivät lemmenlaulut
on täällä elämä raskasta työtä
ja siinä harvemmin onni myötä
sen tietää vain yksin suomalainen
on pohjantähden alla tää koti mulla mainen
mä elämästä laulan sillä oonhan suomalainen
mä rakkaudesta laulan siinä mies ja nainen
pohjantähden alla elää suomalainen
on tässä maassa itsepäinen kansa
kuin yksin kuolema ja virkavalta vain
me käymme vastamäkeen sielu surren
ettei kannattanutkaan
on täällä elämä raskasta työtä
ja siinä harvemmin onni myötä
sen tietää vain yksin suomalainen
on pohjantähden alla tää koti mulla mainen
mä elämästä laulan sillä oonhan suomalainen
mä rakkaudesta laulan siinä mies ja nainen
pohjantähden alla elää suomalainen

know limits
dance end love

dance wedding now

dance tenderly
dance long
we're us beneath love

dance end love
dance end love
dance children
who asking born
dance curtains
that kisses outworn
raise tent shelter now
though every thread torn
dance end love
dance beauty
with burning violin
dance panic
till i'm gathered safely
touch naked hand
touch glove

if want lover i'll anything ask
and want another kind love i'll wear mask
if want partner take hand want strike anger
i stand i'm man
if want boxer i will step ring
and want doctor i'll examine every inch
if want driver climb inside or want take ride
you know i'm man
ah moon's bright chain's tight beast go sleep
i've running promises i made i keep
ah man never got women back begging knees
or i'd crawl baby i'd fall feet
i'd howl beauty dog heat
and i'd claw heart i'd tear sheet i'd say please
please i'm man
and got sleep moment road i will steer
and want walk street alone i'll disappear
if want father child want walk
awhile across sand i'm man

on raglan road autumn day
i saw first i knew
that dark hair weave snare
i might one day rue
i saw danger i passed
along enchanted way
and i said "let grief falling leaf
dawning day"
on grafton street november
tripped lightly along ledge
of deep ravine seen
worth passion's pledge
the queen hearts still making tarts
i making hay
oh i loved much
happiness thrown away
i gave gifts mind
i gave secret sign
that's known artists known
true gods sound stone
and word tint without stint
i gave poems say
with name long dark hair
clouds fields may
on quiet street old ghosts meet
i see walking now
away hurriedly
reason must allow
that i loved i
creature made clay
when angel woes clay lose
wings dawn day
como puede ser verdad
last night i dreamt san pedro
just i'd never gone i knew song
a young girl eyes desert
it seems yesterday far away
tropical island breeze
all nature wild free
this i long
la isla bonita
and samba played
the sun set high
ring ears sting eyes
your spanish lullaby
i fell love san pedro
warm wind carried sea called
te dijo te amo
i prayed days last went fast
tropical island breeze
all nature wild free
this i long
la isla bonita
and samba played
the sun set high
ring ears sting eyes
your spanish lullaby
i want sun warms sky
when time siesta watch go
beautiful faces cares world
where girl loves boy boy loves girl
last night i dreamt san pedro
it seems yesterday far away
tropical island breeze
all nature wild free
this i long
la isla bonita
and samba played
the sun set high
ring ears sting eyes
your spanish lullaby
tropical island breeze
all nature wild free
this i long
la isla bonita
and samba played
the sun set high
ring ears sting eyes
your spanish lullaby

heaven help
when call name
it's little prayer
i'm knees
i wanna take
in midnight hour
i feel power
just prayer
you know i'll take
like child
you whisper softly
you're control child

no end beginning
you're dream
let choir sing
when call name
it's little prayer
i'm knees
i wanna take
in midnight hour
i feel power
just prayer
you know i'll take
life mystery
everyone must stand alone
i hear call name
and feels home

un peu spéciale elle est célibataire
le visage pâle les cheveux en arrière
et j'aime ça
elle se dessine sous des jupes fendues
et je devine des histoires défendues
c'est comme ça
tell'ment si belle quand elle sort
tell'ment si belle je l'aime tell'ment si fort
elle les yeux revolver elle le regard qui tue
elle tiré la première m'a touché c'est foutu
elle les yeux revolver elle le regard qui tue
elle tiré la première elle m'a touché c'est foutu
un peu larguée un peu seule sur la terre
les mains tendues les cheveux en arrière
et j'aime ça
a faire l'amour sur des malentendus
on vit toujours des moments défendus
c'est comme ça
tell'ment si femme quand elle mord
tell'ment si femme je l'aime tell'ment si fort
elle les yeux revolver elle le regard qui tue
elle tiré la première m'a touché c'est foutu
elle les yeux revolver elle le regard qui tue
elle tiré la première m'a touché c'est foutu
son corps s'achève sous des draps inconnus
et moi je rêve de gestes défendus
c'est comme ça
un peu spéciale elle est célibataire
le visage pâle les cheveux en arrière
et j'aime ça
tell'ment si femme quand elle dort
tell'ment si belle je l'aime tell'ment si fort
elle les yeux revolver elle le regard qui tue
elle tiré la première m'a touché c'est foutu
elle les yeux revolver elle le regard qui tue
elle tiré la première elle m'a touché c'est foutu
tonto el que entienda
cuenta una leyenda
que una hembra gitana
conjuró la luna
hasta el amanecer
llorando pedía
al llegar el día
desposar un ca interlude lé
tendrás tu hombre piel morena
desde el cielo habló la luna llena
pero cambio quiero
el hijo primero
que le engendres él
que quien su hijo inmola
para estar sola
poco le iba querer
luna quieres ser ma dre
y encuentras querer
que te haga mujer
dime luna de pla ta
que pretendes hacer
con un nińo de piel
ahahahah
ahahahah
hijo de la lu interlude na
de padre canela nació un nińo
blanco como el lomo de un armińo
con los ojos grises
en vez de aceituna
nińo albino de luna
maldita su estampa
este hijo es un payo
y yo lo callo
luna quieres ser ma dre
y encuentras querer
que te haga mujer
dime luna de pla ta
que pretendes hacer
con un nińo de piel
ahahahah
ahahahah
hijo de la lu interlude na
gitano al creerse deshonrado
se fue su mujer cuchillo en mano
de quién es el hijo
me engańó fijo
y de muerte hirió
luego se hizo al monte
con el nińo en brazos
y allí le abandonó
luna quieres ser ma dre
y encuentras querer
que te haga mujer
dime luna de pla ta
que pretendes hacer
con un nińo de piel
ahahahah
ahahahah
hijo de la lu interlude na
y en las noches que haga luna llena
será porque el nińo esté de buenas
y si el nińo llora
menguará la luna
para hacerle una cuna
y si el nińo llora
menguará la luna
para hacerle una cuna

i sleep
i think implications
of diving deep
and possibly complications
especially night
i worry situations
i know will alright
perhaps imagination
day day reappears
night night heartbeat shows fear
ghost appear fade away
alone sheets
only brings exasperation
it's time walk streets
smell desperation
at least pretty lights
and though little variation
it nullifies night
overkill
day day reappears
night night heartbeat shows fear
ghost appear fade away
come back another day
i sleep
i think implications
of diving deep
and possibly complications
especially night
i worry situations now
i know will alright
it's overkill

life seems will fade away drifting every day
getting lost within nothing matters one
i lost will live simply nothing give
there nothing need end set
things used missing one inside
deathly lost real stand hell i feel
emptiness filling point agony
growing darkness taking dawn i now

no one save late
now i think think i even try
yesterday seems though never existed
death greats warm now i will say goodbye

it got another chance if they take
maybe time it'll loving find
maybe now friends
she's back life feels right
maybe time love end
she`s smiling use smile way back
he`s feelin he used feel way back
tried but something kept waiting
magic moment
maybe time it'll loving find
maybe now friends
she's back life feels right
maybe time
may time
maybe this time
love won`t end…

the last saw
carried away moonlight shadow
he passed worried warning
carried away moonlight shadow
lost riddle saturday night
far away side
he caught middle desperate fight
and find push
the trees whisper evening
carried away moonlight shadow
sing song sorrow grieving
carried away moonlight shadow
all saw silhouette gun
far away side
he shot six times man run
and find push
i stay i pray
see heaven far away
i stay i pray
see heaven one day
four morning
carried away moonlight shadow
i watched vision forming
carried away moonlight shadow
star light silvery night
far away side
will come talk night
but find push
i stay i pray
see heaven far away
i stay i pray
see heaven one day
far away side
caught middle hundred five
the night heavy air alive
but find push
carried away moonlight shadow
carried away moonlight shadow
far away side

lucha de gigantes
convierte el aire en gas natural
un duelo salvaje advierte
lo cerca que ando de entrar
en un mundo descomunal
siento mi fragilidad
vaya pesadilla
corriendo con una bestia detras
dime que es mentira todo
un sueño tonto y más
da miedo la enormidad
donde nadie oye mi voz
deja de engañar quieras ocultar
que pasado sin tropezar
monstruo de papel se contra quien voy
es que acaso hay alguien más aqui
creo en los fantasmas terribles
de algun extraño lugar
y en mis tonterias para hacer tu risa estallar
en un mundo descomunal
siento tu fragilidad
deja de engañar quieras ocultar
que pasado sin tropezar
monstruo de papel se contra quien voy
o es que acaso hay alguien más aqui
deja que pasemos sin miedo

hast du etwas zeit für mich dann singe ich ein lied für dich
von luftballons auf ihrem weg zum horizont
denkst du vielleicht grad' mich dann singe ich ein lied für dich
von luftballons und dass sowas von sowas kommt
luftballons auf ihrem weg zum horizont hielt man für ufos aus dem all
darum schickte ein general eine fliegerstaffel hinterher
alarm zu geben wenn's wär' dabei war da horizont nur luftballons
düsenflieger jeder war ein grosser krieger
hielten sich für captain kirk das gab ein grosses feuerwerk
die nachbarn haben nichts gerafft und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
dabei schoss man horizont auf luftballons
kriegsminister streichholz und benzinkanister
hielten sich für schlaue leute witterten schon fette beute
riefen krieg und wollten macht mann wer hätte das gedacht
dass es einmal soweit kommt wegen luftballons
wegen luftballons
luftballons
jahre krieg ließen keinen platz für sieger
kriegsminister gibts nicht mehr und auch keine düsenflieger
heute zieh ich meine runden seh die welt trümmern liegen
hab' nen luftballon gefunden denk' dich und lass' ihn fliegen
im sturz durch raum und zeit richtung unendlichkeit
fliegen motten das licht genau wie du und ich
irgendwie fängt irgendwann irgendwo die zukunft
ich warte nicht mehr lang liebe wird aus mut gemacht
denk nicht lange nach wir fahr'n auf feuerrädern
richtung zukunft durch die nacht
gib mir die hand ich bau' dir ein schloß aus sand
irgendwie irgendwo irgendwann
die zeit ist reif für ein bißchen zärtlichkeit
irgendwie irgendwo irgendwann
im sturz durch zeit und raum erwacht aus einem traum
nur ein kurzer augenblick dann kehrt die nacht zurück
irgendwie fäng irgendwann irgendwo die zukunft
ich warte nicht mehr lang liebe wird aus mut gemacht
denk nicht lange nach wir fahr'n auf feuerrädern
richtung zukunft durch die nacht
gib mir die hand ich bau dir ein schloß aus sand
irgendwie irgendwo irgendwann
die zeit ist reif für ein bißchen zärtlichkeit
irgendwie irgendwo irgendwann
i got bad you know bad i got
you got easy you know got good
it's getting harder keeping life soul together
i'm sick fighting even though i know i
the cold biting thru every nerve fibre
my broken spirit frozen core
i don't wanna

even one day
and good wish away
wouldn't good side
the grass always greener
wouldn't good live without care
you must joking you know thing
you've got problem i'd stay right
i got harder you dream hard got
stay shoes if know good
the heat stifling burning inside
the sweat coming thru every pore
i don't wanna
wouldn't good shoes
even one day
and good wish away
wouldn't good side
the grass always greener
wouldn't good live without care
crazy goes millions people living foes
maybe late learn love forget hate
mental wounds healing life's bitter shame
i'm going rails crazy train
i'm going rails crazy train
i've listened preachers i've listened fools
i've watched dropouts make rules
one person conditioned rule control
the media sells live role
mental wounds still screaming driving insane
i'm going rails crazy train
i'm going rails crazy train
i know things going wrong
you gotta listen words yehh
heirs cold war become
inheriting troubles i'm mentally numb
crazy i bear
i'm living something fair
mental wounds healing blame
i'm going rails crazy train
i'm going rails crazy train

it's sin somehow
light changing shadow
and casting shroud
over known
unaware ranks grown
driven heart stone
we find alone
in dream proud
on wings night
as daytime stirring
where speechless unite
in silent accord
using words will find strange
and mesmerized light flame
feel new wind change
on wings night
no turning away
from weak weary
no turning away
from coldness inside
just world must share
it's enough stand stare
is dream there'll
no turning away

well i've heard city singers singin love
deeper oceans higher stars
well i come country i know i ain't seen
but i heard oceans salty stars sometimes fall
but justice way i feel
so i sing song things i knew
my love deeper holler stronger rivers
higher pine trees growin' tall upon hill
my love purer snowflakes fall late december
and honest robin springtime window sill
and longer song whippoorwill
from backroads broadway shows million miles
there's least million love songs people love sing
and everyone different everyone's
another way sayin thing
my love deeper holler stronger rivers
higher pine trees growin tall upon hill
my love purer snowflakes fall late december
and honest robin springtime window sill
and longer song whippoorwill
you may think i'm talking foolish

you may wonder i promise now
this love i feel always will
well time i'm killing
i'm longer one guys
as sure i live love i give

as long old men sit talk weather
as long old women sit talk old men
if wonder long i'll faithful

i'm gonna love forever forever amen
they say time takes toll body
makes young girl's brown hair turn grey
but honey i care i ain't love hair
and fell well i'd love anyway
they say time play tricks memory

but easy see happening
i've already forgotten every woman oh darlin'
i'm gonna love forever forever amen
as long old men sit talk weather
as long old women sit talk old men
if wonder long i'll faithful

i'm gonna love forever forever amen

suppose i called tonight
and told i loved
and suppose i said "i wanna come back home"
and suppose i cried said "i think i finally learned lesson
and i'm tired spending time alone
if i told i realized i wanted
and killing far away
would tell loved cry together
or simply laugh say
"i told oh i told
i told someday come crawling back
asking take
i told go
now i found somebody new will never break heart two again"
if i got knees
and told i forever
would take hand
would oldtime feeling
would laugh talk hours
the way love first began
would tell missed
and lonely
and waited day i returned
and live love forever
and i'm one
or say tables finally turned
"i told oh i told
i told someday come crawling back
asking take
i told go
now i found somebody new will never break heart two again"
pretty paper pretty ribbons blue
wrap present darlin'
pretty pencils write i love

crowded streets busy feet hustle
downtown shoppers christmas nigh
there sits alone sidewalk
hoping pass

you'd better hurry time fly
and distance ringing laughter
and midst laughter cries
pretty paper pretty ribbons blue
wrap present darlin'
pretty pencils write i love

à m'asseoir sur un banc cinq minutes avec toi
et regarder les gens tant qu'y en
te parler du bon temps qu'est mort ou qui reviendra
en serrant dans ma main tes p'tits doigts
puis donner à bouffer à des pigeons idiots
leur filer des coups d'pieds pour de faux
et entendre ton rire qui lézarde les murs
qui sait surtout guérir mes blessures
te raconter un peu comment j'étais minot les bonbecs fabuleux
qu'on piquait chez l' marchand carensac et minto caramel à un franc
et les mistrals gagnants
à r'marcher sous la pluie cinq minutes avec toi
et regarder la vie tant qu'il en
te raconter la terre en te bouffant des yeux
te parler de ta mère un p'tit peu
et sauter dans les flaques pour la faire râler
bousiller nos godasses et s'marrer
et entendre ton rire comme entend la mer
s'arrêter repartir en arrière
te raconter surtout les carambars d'antan et les coco boers
et les vrais roudoudous qui nous coupaient les lèvres et nous niquaient les dents
et les mistrals gagnants

à m'asseoir sur un banc cinq minutes avec toi
et regarder le soleil qui s'en va
te parler du bon temps qui est mort et je m'en fous
te dire que les méchants c'est pas nous
que si moi je suis barge ce n'est que de tes yeux
car ils ont l'avantage d'être deux
et entendre ton rire s'envoler aussi haut
que s'envolent les cris des oiseaux
te raconter enfin qu'il faut aimer la vie et l'aimer même si
le temps est assassin et emporte avec lui les rires des enfants
et les mistrals gagnants

to find road back home gain

like tears star
on rain will say
how fragile

like tears star

outside another yellow moon
has punched hole nighttime yes
i climb window street
i'm shining new dime
the downtown trains full
with brooklyn girls
they try hard break little worlds
well wave hand scatter crows
they nothing will capture heart
they're thorns without rose
be careful dark
oh i one chose one
oh baby hear now can't hear now

the smart money's harlow
and moon street
the shadow boys breaking laws
and east east saint louis
and wind making speeches
and rain sounds round applause
napoleon weeping
in carnival saloon
his invisible fiance's mirror
and band going home
it's raining hammers raining nails
it's true nothing left
and time time time
and time time time
and time time time love
and time time time
and pretend orphans
and memory's train
you see getting smaller pulls away
and things remember
tell things forget
that history puts saint every dream
well said stick around
until bandages came
but mama's boys know quit
and matilda asks sailors
are dreams prayers
so close eys son hurt bit
and time time time
and time time time
and time time time love
and time time time
well things pretty lousy
for calendar girl
the boys dive right cars splash street
and roll
she pulls razor boot
and thousand pigeons fall around feet
so put candle window
and kiss upon lips
as dish outside window fills rain
just stranger
with weeds heart
and pay fiddler 'till i come back
and time time time
and time time time
and time time time love
and time time time

von dir keine spur die wohnung ist leer
und mein herz wie blei schwer
ich geh' kaputt und du bist wieder bei ihm
ich weiss nur eins jetzt ist schluss
und dass ich um dich kämpfen muss
wo bist du sag mir wo bist du
wahnsinn warum schickst du mich die hölle
eiskalt lässt du meine seele erfrier'n
das ist wahnsinn du spielst mit
meinen gefühlen
und mein stolz liegt längst schon auf dem müll
doch noch weiss ich ich will ich will dich
ich lauf im kreis von früh bis spät
denn ich weiß dass ohne dich nichts geht
ich brauche luft bevor mein herz erstickt
und wie ein wolf renn´ ich durch die stadt
such hungrig uns´re kneipen ab
wo bist du sag mir wo bist du
looking window
it's story love
can hear
came back yesterday
i'm moving farther away
want near
all i needed love gave
all i needed another day
and i knew
only
sometimes i think name
when game
and i need
listening words say
it's getting harder stay
when i see
all i needed love gave
all i needed another day
and i knew
only
this gonna take long time
and i wonder mine
can't take
wonder understand
it's touch hand
behind closed door
all i needed love gave
all i needed another day
and i knew
only
only
het kerstochtend ik weet 't nog zo goed mijn konijnenhok leeg
en moeder zei dat ik niet de schuur mocht komen
en als ik lief ging spelen dat ik dan wat lekkers kreeg
zij wist ook niet waar flappie uit kon hangen
ze zou 't pappa vragen maar omdat die bezig
in het fietsenschuurtje moest ik maar een uurtje goed naar flappie zoeken
hij liep vast wel ergens op 't gras
maar ik 't hok toch goed dichtgedaan zoals ik dat elke avond deed
ik weet ook niet waarom ik dat deed
'k heel lang voor 't hok gestaan alsof ik wist wat ik nu weet
het eerste kerstdag wij naar flappie zoeken
vader die zocht gewoon mee
bij de bomen en 't water maar niet dat fietsenschuurtje
want daar kon ie toch niet zitten en ik schudde nee
we zochten samen samen tot de koffie
de familie aan de koffie maar ik hoefde niet
ik dacht aan flappie en dat 't 's nachts zo koud kon vriezen
m'n hoofdje stil gebogen dikke tranen van verdriet
het eerste kerstdag
er werd luidruchtig gegeten maar dat deed niet zoveel
ik dacht aan flappie m'n eigen kleine flappie
waar zou die lopen geen hap ging door m'n keel
toen na de soep het hoofdgerecht zou komen sprak m’n vader uiterst grappig
"kijk youp daar flappy dan"
ik zie de zilv'ren schaal nog en daar lag 'ie drie stukken
voor 't eerst zag ik m'n vader als 'n vreselijke man
en ik ben gillend en stampend naar bed gegaan
heb eerst een uur liggen huilen op de sprei
"flappy van mij"
'k heb heel lang voor 't raam gestaan maar 't hok stond er maar verlaten bij
het tweede kerstdag moeder weet 't nog zo goed vaders bed leeg
en ik zei dat zij niet de schuur mocht komen
en als ze lief ging spelen dat ze dan wat lekkers kreeg
