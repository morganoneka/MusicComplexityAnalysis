on m'a vu dans le vercors
voleur d'amphores
au fond des criques
j'ai fait la cour a des murenes
j'ai fait l'amour
j'ai fait le mort
a la station balneaire

dans cette boite cranienne
tes pensees je les faisais miennes
t'accaparer seulement
d'estrade en estrade
j'ai fait danser tant de malentendus
des kilometres de vie en rose
un jour au cirque
un autre a chercher a te plaire
dresseur de loulous
dynamateur d'acqueducs

you're the one who never let me sleep
through my mind and through my soul
you touch my lips
you're the one that i can't wait to see
when you're here by my side i'm in ecstacy
i'm all alone without you
but days are dark without the glimpse of you
now that you come into my life
i feel complete
the flowers bloom the morning shines and i can see
your love is like the sun
that lights up my whole world
i feel the warmth inside
your love is like a river
that flows down through my veins
i feel the chill inside
every time i hear music played
reminds me of the things that we've been through
in my mind i can't believe it's true
but in my heart the reality is you
i'm all alone without you
but days are dark without the glimpse of you
now that you come into my life
i feel complete
the flowers bloom the morning shines and i can see
your love is like the sun
that lights up my whole world
i feel the warmth inside
your love is like a river
that flows down through my veins
i feel the chill inside
your love is like the sun
that lights up my whole world
i feel the warmth inside
your love is like a river
that flows down through my veins
i feel the chill inside
your love is like the sun

two young people without a thing
say some vows and spread their wings
and settle down to just what they need livin' on love
she don't care 'bout what's in style
she just likes the way he smiles
it takes more than marble and tile livin' on love
livin' on love buyin' on time
without somebody nothin' ain't worth a dime
just like an old fashioned story book rhyme livin' on love
it sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
but love can walk through fire without blinkin'
it doesn't take much when you give enough livin' on love
two old people without a thing
children gone but still they sing
side beside in that front porch swing livin' on love
he can't see anymore she can barely sweep the floor
hand in hand they'll walk though that door livin' on love
livin' on love buyin' on time
without somebody nothin' ain't worth a dime
just like an old fashioned sory book rhyme livin' on love
it sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
but love can walk through fire without blinkin'
it doesn't take much when you give enough livin' on love
no it doesn' take much when you give enough livin' on love

an old man turned ninetyeight
he won the lottery and died the next day
it´s a black fly in your chardonnay
it´s a death row pardon two minutes too late
isn´t it ironic don´t you think
it´s like rain on your wedding day
it´s a free ride when you´ve already paid
it´s the good advice that you just didn´t take
who would´ve thought it figures

he packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
he waited his whole damn life to take that flight
and as the plane crashed down he thought
" well isn´t this nice "
and isn´t it ironic don´t you think
it´s like rain on your wedding day
it´s a free ride when you´ve already paid
it´s the good advice that you just didn´t take
who would´ve thought it figures
well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
when you think everything´s okay and everything´s going right
and life has a funny way of helping you out when
you think everything´s gone wrong and everything blows up
in your face
a traffic jam when you´re already late
a nosmoking sign on your cigarette break
it´s like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
it´s meeting the man of my dreams
and then meeting his beautiful wife

a little too ironic and yeah i really do think
it´s like rain on your wedding day

life has a funny funny way of helping you out

it's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
without saying a word you can light up the dark
try as i may i could never explain
what i hear when you don't say a thing
the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
the touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever i fall
you say it best when you say nothing at instrumental all
all day long i can hear people talking out loud
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
old mister webster could never define
what's been said between your heart and mine
the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
the touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever i fall
you say it best when you say nothing at instrumental all
the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
the touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever i fall
you say it best when you say nothing at instrumental all

at kahit wala ka na nangangarap at umaasa pa rin ako
muling makita ka at makasama ka sa araw ng pasko
pasko na naman ngunit wala ka pa
hanggang kailan kaya ako maghihintay sa iyo

oh get me away from here i'm dying
play me a song to set me free
nobody writes them like they used to
so it may as well be me
here on my own now after hours
here on my own now on a bus
think of it this way
you could either be successful or be us
with our winning smiles and us
with our catchy tunes oh us
now we're photogenic
you know we don't stand a chance we don't stand a chance
oh i'll settle down with some old story
about a boy who's just like me
thought there was love in everything and everyone
you're so naive
they always reach a sorry ending
they always get it in the end
still it was worth it as i turned the pages solemnly and then
with a winning smile the boy
with naivety succeeds
at the final moment i cried
i always cry at endings
oh that wasn't what i meant to say at all
from where i'm sitting rain
falling against the lonely tenement
has set my mind to wander
into the windows of my lovers
they never know unless i write
"this is no declaration i just thought i'd let you know goodbye"
said the hero in the story
"it is mightier than swords
i could kill you sure
but i could only make you cry with these words"
cry with these words
cry with these words
ooh get me away i'm dying
get me away i'm dying

let us burn one from end to end
and pass it over
to me my friend
burn it long well burn it slow
to light me up before i go
if you don't like my fire
then don't come around
cause i'm gonna burn one down
yes i'm gonna burn one down
my choice is what i choose to do
and if i'm causing no harm
it shouldn't bother you
your choice is who you choose to be
and if you're causin' no harm
then you're alright with me
if you don't like my fire
then don't come around
cause i'm gonna burn one down
yes i'm gonna burn one down
herb the gift from the earth
and what's from the earth
is of the greatest worth
so before you knock it try it first
you'll see it's a blessing
and not a curse
if you don't like my fire
then don't come around
cause i'm gonna burn one down
yes i'm gonna burn one down
don't stray
don't ever go away
i should be much to smart for this
you know it gets the better of me
some times
when you and i collide
i fall into an ocean of you
pull me out in time
don't let me drown
let me down
i say its all because of you
and here i go
losing my control
i'm practicing your name
so i can say it to your face
it doesn't seem right
to look you in the eye
and let all the things you mean to me
come tumbling out my mouth
indeed its time
tell you why
i say its infinately true
say you'll stay
don't come and go
like you do
sway my way
yeah i need to know
all about you
and there's no cure
and no way to be sure
why everythings turned inside out
we're still in so much doubt
it makes me so tired
i feel so uninspired
my head is battling with my heart
my logic has been torn apart
and now
it all turns sour
'cause we sing every afternoon
its all because of you
its all because of you
you can tell the world
you can burn my clothes when i am gone
and laugh and joke about me on the phone
you can tell my arms
you can tell my feet to hit the floor
they won't be reaching out for you no more
but don't tell my heart
i just don't think it'd understand
he might blow up and kill this man
uuuuuuu
you can tell your maw
you can tell your dog that bit my leg
he never really liked me anyway
go tell your aunt louise
myself already knows i'm not okay
it might be walkin' out on me one day
but don't tell my heart
i just don't think it'd understand
he might blow up and kill this man
uuuuuuu
but don't tell my heart
i just don't think it'd understand
he might blow up and kill this man
uuuuuuu

now you all know
the bards and their songs
when hours have gone by
i'll close my eyes
in a world far away
we may meet again
but now hear my song
about the dawn of the night
let's sing the bards' song
tomorrow will take us away
far from home
no one will ever know our names
but the bards' songs will remain
tomorrow will take it away
the fear of today
it will be gone
due to our magic songs
there's only one song
left in my mind
tales of a brave man
who lived far from here
now the bard songs are over
and it's time to leave
no one should ask you for the name of the one
who tells the story
tomorrow will take us away
far from home
no one will ever know our names
but the bards' songs will remain
tomorrow all will be known
and you're not alone
so don't be afraid
in the dark and cold
'cause the bards' songs will remain
they all will remain
in my thoughts and in my dreams
they're always in my mind
these songs of hobbits dwarves and men
and elves
come close your eyes
you can see them too

i don't feel the sun's commin out today
stayin in it's gonna find another way
as i sit here in this misery
i don't think i'll ever know lord
see the sun from here
and oh as i fade away
they'll all look at me and say and they'll say
hey look at him i'll never live that way
but thats ok they're just afraid of change
and when you feel life ain't worth livin'
you've gotta stand up and take a look around you
then look way up to the sky
and when your deepest thoughts are broken
keep on dreamin boy cause when you stop dreamin
it's time to die
and as we all play parts of tomorrow
some ways will work and other ways we'll play
but i know we can't all stay here forever
so i want to write my words on the face of the day
and oh as i fade away
they'll all look at me and say and they'll say
hey look at him and where he is these days
when life is hard you have to change
when life is hard you have to change
ooohhh hmmm hmmm hmmm
d chorus
all i can say is that my life is pretty plain
i like watchin’ the puddles gather rain
and all i can do is just pour some tea for two
and speak my point of view but it’s not sane it’s not sane
i just want someone to say to me oh
i’ll always be there when you wake yeah
ya know i’d like to keep my cheeks dry today
so stay with me and i’ll have it made
and i don’t understand why i sleep all day
and i start to complain that there’s no rain
and all i can do is read a book to stay awake
it rips my life away but it’s a great escape
all i can say is that my life is pretty plain
ya don’t like my point of view
ya think that i’m insane
its not sane it’s not sane
i just want someone to say to me oh
i’ll always be there when you wake yeah
ya know i’d like to keep my cheeks dry today
so stay with me and i’ll have it made
i'll have it made
i'll have it made
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
i never thought i'd die alone
i laughed the loudest who'd have known
i trace the cord back to the wall
no wonder it was never plugged in at all
i took my time i hurried up
the choice was mine i didn't think enough
i'm too depressed to go on
you'll be sorry when i'm gone
i never conquered rarely came
just held such better days
days when i still felt alive
we couldn't wait to get outside
the world was wide too late to try
the tour was over we'd survived
i couldn't wait till i got home
to pass the time in my room alone
i never thought i'd die alone
another six months i'll be unknown
give all my things to all my friends
you'll never step foot in my room again
you'll close it off board it up
remember the time that i spilled the cup
of apple juice in the hall
please tell mom this is not her fault
i never conquered rarely came
just held such better days
days when i still felt alive
we couldn't wait to get outside
the world was wide too late to try
the tour was over we'd survived
i couldn't wait till i got home
to pass the time in my room alone
i never conquered rarely came
tomorrow holds such better days
days when i can still feel alive
when i can't wait to get outside
the world is wide the time goes by

i can't wait till i get home
to pass the time in my room alone

on losing and failing
when i move i'm flailing now
and it's happened once again

but everybody's gone
and i've been here for too long
to face this on my own
well i guess this is growing up

and maybe i'll see you
at a movie sneak preview

on the arm of that guy
and i'll smile and you'll wave
we'll pretend it's okay
the charade it won't last
when he's gone i won't come back
and it'll happen once again

that leave you feelin so stoned
hey hey i guess it hasn't hit me yet
i fell thru this crack
and i kinda lost my head
i stand transfixed
before this street light
watching the snow fall on this coold december night
i never thought this could happen
but somehow the feeling is gone
you got sick of the patterns
and i got lost in this song
hey hey i guess it hasn't hit me yet
i fell thru this crack
and i kinda lost my head
i stand transfixed
before this street light
watching the snow fall on this coold december night
hey hey i guess it hasn't hit me yet
i fell thru this crack
and i kinda lost my head
i stand transfixed
before this street light
watching the snow fall on this coold december night
and out in the middle of lake ontario
the same snow is falling
on the deep silent water
the great dark wonder
into the waves of my heart
into the waves of my heart


it doesn't matter what i say
so long as i sing with inflection
that makes you feel that i'll convey
some inner truth of vast reflection
but i've said nothing so far
and i can keep it up as long as it takes
and it don't matter who you are
if i'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks
because the hook brings you back
i ain't tellin' you no lie
the hook brings you back
on that you can rely
there is something amiss
i am being insincere
in fact i don't mean any of this
still my confession draws you near
to confuse the issue i refer
to familiar heroes from long ago
no matter how much peter loved her
what made the pan refuse to grow
was that the hook brings you back
i ain't tellin' you no lie
the hook brings you back
on that you can rely
it doesn't matter what i say
so long as i sing with inflection
that makes you feel that i'll convey
some inner truth of vast reflection
but i've said nothing so far
and i can keep it up as long as it takes
and it don't matter who you are
if i'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks
suck it in suck it in suck it in if you're rin tin tin or anne boleyn
make a desperate move or else you'll win
and then begin to
see what you're doing to me this mtv is not for free
it's so pc it's killing me
so desperately i'll sing to thee of
love sure but also rage and hate and pain and fear of self and i can't keep these feelings on the
shelf i've tried well no in fact i've lied
could be financial suicide but i've got too much pride inside to
hide or slide i'll do as i decide and let it ride until i've died and only then shall i abide
this tide of catchy little tunes
or hip three minute ditties
i wanna bust all your balloons
i wanna burn all of your cities
to the ground i've found
i will not mess around
unless i play then hey
i will go on all day hear what i
say i have a prayer to pray
that's really all this was
and when i'm feeling stuck and need a buck i don't rely on luck because
the hook brings you back
i ain't tellin' you no lie
the hook brings you back
on that you can rely
once upon a midnight dearie
i woke with something in my head
i couldn't escape the memory
of a phone call and of what you said
like a game show contestant with a parting gift
i could not believe my eyes
when i saw through the voice of a trusted friend
who needs to humor me and tell me lies
yeah humor me and tell me lies
and i'll lie too and say i don't mind
and as we seek so shall we find
and when you're feeling open i'll still be here
but not without a certain degree of fear
of what will be with you and me
i still can see things hopefully
but you
why you wanna give me a runaround
is it a surefire way to speed things up
when all it does is sl ow me down
and shake me and my confidence
about a great many things
but i've been there i can see it cower
like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
of a bad play where the heroes are right
and nobody thinks or expects too much
and hollywood's calling for the movie rights
singing hey babe let's keep in touch
hey baby let's keep in touch
but i want more than a touch i want you to reach me
and show me all the things no one else can be
so what you feel becomes mine as well
and soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
what's yours and mine the finshings fine
and it doesn't have to rhyme so don't feed me a line
but you
why you wanna give me a runaround
is it a surefire way to speed things up
when all it does is sl ow me down

tra la la la la bomba dear this is the pilot speaking
and i've got some news for you
it seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
and there ain't a whole lot that you can do
oh sure the banner may be torn and wind's gotten colder
perhaps i've grown a little cynical
but i know no matter what the waitress brings
i shall drink it and always be full
yeah i will drink it and always be full
oh i like coffee and i like tea
i'd like to be able to enter a final plea
i still got this dream that you just can't shake
i love you to the point you can no longer take
well all right okay so be that way
i hope and pray that there's something left to say
but you
why you wanna give me a runaround
is it a surefire way to speed things up
when all it does is slow me down
but you
why you wanna give me a runaround
is it a surefire way to speed things up
when all it does is sl ow me down
repeat to fade
do you feel like a chain store practically floored
one of many zeros kicked around bored
your ears are full but you're empty holding out your heart
to people who never really care how you are
so give me coffee and tv easily
i've seen so much i'm going blind
and i'm braindead virtually
sociability it's hard enough for me
take me away from this big bad world
and agree to marry me so we can start over again
do you go to the country it isn't very far
there's people there who will hurt you 'cause of who you are
your ears are full of their language there's wisdom there you're sure
till the words start slurring and you can't find the door
so give me coffee and tv easily
i've seen so much i'm going blind
and i'm braindead virtually
sociability it's hard enough for me
take me away from this big bad world
and agree to marry me so we can start over again

i've seen so much i'm going blind

when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i would offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love
when evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love
i know you haven't made your mind up yet
but i would never do you wrong
i've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong
i'd go hungry i'd go black and blue
i'd go crawling down the avenue
there's nothing that i wouldn't do
to make you feel my love
the storms are raging on the rollin' sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet
i could make you happy make your dreams come true
there’s nothing that i would not do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love
there is nothing that i would not do
to make you feel my love
perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
an' cov'rin' the crossroads i'm standing at
or maybe it's the weather or something like that
but mama you been on my mind
i don't mean trouble please don't put me down or get upset
i am not pleadin' or sayin' "i can't forget"
i do not walk the floor bowed down an' bent but yet
mama you been on my mind
even though my mind is hazy an' my thoughts they might be narrow
where you been don't bother me nor bring me down in sorrow
it don't even matter to me where you're wakin' up tomorrow
but mama you're just on my mind
i am not askin' you to say words like "yes" or "no"
please understand me i got no place for you t' go
i'm just breathin' to myself pretendin' not that i don't know
mama you been on my mind
when you wake up in the mornin' baby look inside your mirror
you know i won't be next to you you know i won't be near
i'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
as someone who has had you on his mind
this romeo is bleeding
but you can't see his blood
it's nothing but some feelings
that this old dog kicked up
it's been raining since you left me
now i'm drowning in the flood
you see i've always been a fighter
but without you i give up
now i can't sing a love song
like the way it's meant to be
well i guess i'm not that good anymore
but baby that's just me
yeah i will love you baby
al ways
and i'll be there forever and a day
al ways
i'll be there till the stars don't shine
till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
i know when i die you'll be on my mind
and i'll love you
al ways
now your pictures that you left behind
are just memories of a different life
some that made us laugh some that made us cry
one that made you have to say goodbye
what i'd give to run my fingers through your hair
to touch your lips to hold you near
when you say your prayers try to understand
i've made mistakes i'm just a man
when he holds you close when he pulls you near
when he says the words you've been needing to hear
i'll wish i was him 'cause those words are mine
to say to you till the end of time
and i will love you baby
al ways
and i'll be there forever and a day
al ways
if you told me to cry for you
i could
if you told me to die for you
i would
take a look at my face
there's no price i won't pay
to say these words to you
well there ain't no luck in these loaded dice
but baby if you give me just one more try
we can pack up our old dreams and our old lives
we'll find a place where the sun still shines
yeah i will love you baby
al ways
and i'll be there forever and a day
al ways
i'll be there till the stars don't shine
till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
i know when i die you'll be on my mind
and i'll love you
al ways
always
sitting here wasted and wounded
this old piano
trying hard to capture the moment
this morning i don't know
'cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head
and some blond gave me nightmares
think she's still in my bed
as i dream about movies they won't make of me when i'm dead
with an ironclad fist
i wake up and french kiss the morning
while some marching band keeps its own beat
in my head while we're talking
about all of the things that i long to believe
about love the truth what you mean to me
and the truth is
baby you're all that i need
i wanna lay
you down in a bed of roses
for tonight
i sleep on a bed of nails
oh i want to be
just as close as
the holy ghost is
and lay you down
on a bed of roses
well i'm so far away
each step that i take is on my way home
a king's ransom in dimes
given each night to see through this payphone
still i run out of time
or it's hard to get through
till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
i'll just close my eyes whisper
baby blind love is true
i wanna lay
you down in a bed of roses
for tonight
i sleep on a bed of nails
oh i want to be
just as close as
the holy ghost is
and lay you down
on a bed of roses
well this hotel bar hangover
whiskey's gone dry the barkeeper's wig's crooked
i might have said yeah
but i laughed so hard i think i died uh yeah
now as you close your eyes
know i'll be thinking about you
while my mistress she calls me
to stand in her spotlight again
tonight i won't be alone
but you know that don't mean i'm not lonely
i've got nothing to prove for it's you
that i'd die to defend
i wanna lay
you down in a bed of roses
for tonight
i sleep on a bed of nails
oh i want to be
just as close as
the holy ghost is
and lay you down
i wanna lay
you down in a bed of roses
for tonight
i sleep on a beed of nails
i want to be
just as close as
the holy ghost is
lay you down
on a bed of roses
turn down the lights turn down the bed
turn down these voices inside my head
lay down with me tell me no lies
just hold me close don't patronize
don't patronize me
cause i can't make you love me if you don't
you can't make your heart feel something it won't
here in the dark in these final hours
i will lay down my heart and i'll feel the power
but you won't no you won't
cause i can't make you love me if you don't
i'll close my eyes then i won't see
the love you don't feel when you're holding me
morning will come and i'll do what's right
just give me till then to give up this fight
and i will give up this fight
cause i can't make you love me if you don't
you can't make your heart feel something it won't
here in the dark in these final hours
i will lay down my heart and i'll feel the power
but you won't no you won't

when the sun goes down on my side of town
that lonesome feelin' comes to my door
an' the whole world turns blue
there's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
i got a table for two way in the back
where i sit alone and i think of losin' you
i spend most every night beneath the light of a neon moon
now if you lose your one and only
there's always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon
i think of two young lovers arunnin' wild and free
i close my eyes and sometimes see
you in the shadows of this smokefilled room
no tellin' how many tears i've sat here and cried
or how many lies that i've lied
tellin' my poor heart she'll come back someday
oh but i'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
if you lose your one and only
there's always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon
e||||
the jukebox plays on drink by drink
and the words to ev'ry sad song seem to say what i think
and this hurt inside of me it ain't never gonna end
oh but i'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
if you lose your one and only
there's always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon
watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon ohhh
watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon
i was bruised and battered i couldn't tell what i felt
i was unrecognizable to myself
saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
oh brother are you gonna leave me wasting like this on the
streets of philadelphia
i walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
i heard voices of friends vanished and gone
at night i hear the blood in my veins
just as black and whispery as the rain on the
streets of philadelphia
ain't no angel gonna greet me
it's just you and i my friend
and my clothes don't fit me no more i walked a
the night is falling i'm lying awake
i can feel my self fading away
so receive me brother with your faithless kiss or
will we leave each other alone like this on the
streets of philadelphia

man walkin‘ long the railroad tracks
goin‘ some place there’s no going back
hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
shelter line stretchin‘ round the corner
welcome to the new world order
no home no job no peace no rest
the highway is alive tonight
but nobody’s kiddin‘ nobody about where it goes
i’m sittin‘ down here in the campfire light
searchin‘ for the ghost of tom joad
he pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
in a cardboard box neath the underpass
got a oneway ticket to the promised land
you got hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
bathin‘ in the city aquaeduct
the highway is alive tonight
where it’s headed everybody knows
i’m sittin‘ down here in the campfire light
waitin' on the ghost of tom joad
now tom said "mom wherever there’s cop beatin‘ a guy
wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
look for me mom i’ll be there
wherever there’s somebody fightin‘ for a place to stand
or decent job or helping hand
look in their eyes mom you’ll see me"

el carino que te tengo
no te lo puedo negar
se me sale la babita
yo no lo puedo evitar
cuando juanica y chan chan
en el mar cernían arena
como sacudía el 'jibe'
a chan chan le daba pena
limpia el camino de pajas
que yo me quiero sentar
en aquel tronco que veo
y así no puedo llegar
de alto cedro voy para marcané
llego a cueto voy para mayarí
de alto cedro voy para marcané
llego a cueto voy para mayarí

vem har tänt den stjärnan som speglas i ditt öga
vem tog mörkret bort i hedars blick din första natt
vem har flätat kronan av strå omkring din panna
vem har fört tre vise till vårt stall min kära skatt
är du en av tusen små
är du han dom väntar på
du mitt lilla barn en ängel givit namn
är du jordens dolda skatt
jag fått skydda denna natt
är det själva himlen som jag gungar i min famn
vem har väckt den rädslan som lät ditt hjärta gråta
varför tar din hand så hårt ett grep om mammas hår
runt oss dansar skuggor nu är ängeln borta
han sa så mycket vackert mycket mer än jag förstår
är du en av tusen små
är du han dom väntar på
du mitt lilla barn en ängel givit namn
är du jordens dolda skatt
jag fått skydda denna natt
är det själva himlen som jag gungar i min famn
givatt dina dagar får bli till andras glädje
givat alla möter dig med kärlek mild och god
aldrig ska jag glömma de ord som jag fick höra
vad som än oss hända vill dom ge oss kraft och mod
är du en av tusen små
är du han dom väntar på
du mitt lilla barn en ängel givit namn
är du jordens dolda skatt
jag fått skydda denna natt
är det själva himlen som jag gungar i min famn
vem har tänt den stjärnan som speglas i ditt öga
himmeldiamanter över staden betlehem
when i was young i never needed anyone
and makin' love was just for fun
those days are gone
livin' alone i think of all the friends i've known
when i dial the telephone
nodody's home
all by my self don't wanna be
all by my self
anymore
hard to be sure
sometimes i feel so insecure
and love's so distant and obscure
remains the cure
all by my self don't wanna be
all by my self anymore
all by my self don't wanna be
all by my self anymore
when i was young i never needed anyone
and makin' love was just for fun
those days are gone
all by myself don't wanna be
all by my self any more
all by myself don't wanna live
oh
don't wanna live
by myself by myself any more


tale as old as time
true as it can be
barely even friends
then somebody bends
unexpectedly
just a little change
small to say the least
both a little scared
neither one prepared
beauty and the beast
ever just the same
ever a surprise
ever as before
ever just as sure
as the sun will rise
tale as old as time
tune as old as song
bittersweet and strange
finding you can change
learning you were wrong
certain as the sun
rising in the east
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
for all those times you stood by me
for all the truth that you made me see
for all the joy you brought to my life
for all the wrong that you made right
for every dream you made come true
for all the love i found in you
i'll be forever thankful baby
you're the one who held me up
never let me fall
you're the one who saw me through through it all
you were my strength when i was weak
you were my voice when i couldn't speak
you were my eyes when i couldn't see
you saw the best there was in me
lifted me up when i couldn't reach
you gave me faith 'coz you believed
i'm everything i am
because you loved me
you gave me wings and made me fly
you touched my hand i could touch the sky
i lost my faith you gave it back to me
you said no star was out of reach
you stood by me and i stood tall
i had your love i had it all
i'm grateful for each day you gave me
maybe i don't know that much
but i know this much is true
i was blessed because i was loved by you
you were my strength when i was weak
you were my voice when i couldn't speak
you were my eyes when i couldn't see
you saw the best there was in me
lifted me up when i couldn't reach
you gave me faith 'coz you believed
i'm everything i am
because you loved me
you were always there for me
the tender wind that carried me
a light in the dark shining your love into my life

through the lies you were the truth

you were my strength when i was weak
you were my voice when i couldn't speak

you were my eyes when i couldn't see
you saw the best there was in me
lifted me up when i couldn't reach
you gave me faith 'coz you believed
i'm everything i am
because you loved me
there were nights when the wind was so cold
that my body froze in bed
if i just listened to it
right outside the window
there were days when the sun was so cruel
that all the tears turned to dust
and i just knew my eyes were
drying up forever
i finished crying in the instant that you left
and i can't remember where or when or how
and i banished every memory you and i had ever made
but when you touch me like this
and you hold me like that
i just have to admit
that it's all coming back to me
when i touch you like this
and i hold you like that
it's so hard to believe but
it's all coming back to me
it's all coming back it's all coming back to me now
there were moments of gold
and there were flashes of light
there were things i'd never do again
but then they'd always seemed right
there were nights of endless pleasure
it was more than any laws allow
baby baby
if i kiss you like this
and if you whisper like that
it was lost long ago
but it's all coming back to me
if you want me like this
and if you need me like that
it was dead long ago
but it's all coming back to me
it's so hard to resist
and it's all coming back to me
i can barely recall
but it's all coming back to me now
there were those empty threats and hollow lies
and whenever you tried to hurt me
i just hurt you even worse
and so much deeper
there were hours that just went on for days
when alone at last we'd count up all the chances
that were lost to us forever
but you were history with the slamming of the door
and i made myself so strong again somehow
and i never wasted any of my time on you since then
but if i touch you like this
and if you kiss me like that
it was so long ago
but it's all coming back to me
if you touch me like this
and if i kiss you like that
it was gone with the wind
but it's all coming back to me
it's all coming back it's all coming back to me now
there were moments of gold
and there were flashes of light
there were things i'd never do again
but then they'd always seemed right
there were nights of endless pleasure
it was more than all your laws allow
baby baby
when you touch me like this
and when you hold me like that
it was gone with the wind
but it's all coming back to me
when you see me like this
and when i see you like that
then we see what we want to see
all coming back to me
the flesh and the fantasies
all coming back to me
i can barely recall
but it's all coming back to me now
if you forgive me all this
if i forgive you all that
we forgive and forget
and it's all coming back to me
when you see me like this
and when i see you like that
we see just what we want to see
all coming back to me
the flesh and the fantasies
all coming back to me
i can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now
it's all coming back to me now
and when you kiss me like this
it's all coming back to me now
and when i touch you like that
it's all coming back to me now
if you do it like this
it's all coming back to me now
and if we
every night in my dreams
i see you i feel you
that is how i know you go on
far across the distance
and spaces between us
you have come to show you go on
near far where ever you are
i believe that the heart does go on
once more you open the door
and you're here in my heart and
my heart will go on and on
love can touch us one time
and last for life time
and never let go till we're gone
love was when i loved you one true time i hold to
in my life we'll always go on
near far wher ever you are
i believe that the heart does go on
once more you open the door
and you're here in my heart
and my heart will go on and on
you're hear there's nothing i fear
and i know that my heart will go on
we'll stay forever this way
you are safe in my heart
and my heart will go on and on
o holy night
the stars are brightly shining
it is the night of our dear saviour's birth
long lay the world in sin and error pining
till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
a thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
fall on your knees
oh hear the angel voices
o night divine
oh night when christ was born
o night divine
oh night
oh night divine
truly he taught us to love one another
his law is love and his gospel is peace
chains he shall break for the slave is our brother
and in his name all oppression shall cease

j'ai compris tous les mots j'ai bien compris merci
raisonnable et nouveau c'est ainsi par ici
que les choses ont changé que les fleurs ont fané
que le temps d'avant c'était le temps d'avant
que si tout zappe et lasse les amours aussi passent
il faut que tu saches
j'irai chercher ton coeur si tu l'emportes ailleurs
même si dans tes danses d'autres dansent tes heures
j'irai chercher ton âme dans les froids dans les flammes
je te jetterai des sorts pour que tu m'aimes encore
que tu m'aimes encore
fallait pas commencer m'attirer me toucher
fallait pas tant donner moi je sais pas jouer
on me dit qu'aujourd'hui on me dit que les autres font ainsi
je ne suis pas les autres
avant que l'on s'attache avant que l'on se gâche
je veux que tu saches
j'irai chercher ton coeur si tu l'emportes ailleurs
même si dans tes danses d'autres dansent tes heures
j'irai chercher ton ame dans les froids dans les flammes
je te jetterai des sorts pour que tu m'aimes encore
je trouverai des langages pour chanter tes louanges
je ferai nos bagages pour d'infinies vendanges
les formules magiques des marabouts d'afrique
j'les dirai sans remords pour que tu m'aimes encore
je m'inventerai reine pour que tu me retiennes
je me ferai nouvelle pour que le feu reprenne
je deviendrai ces autres qui te donnent du plaisir
vos jeux seront les nôtres si tel est ton désir
plus brillante plus belle pour une autre étincelle
je me changerai en or pour que tu m'aimes encore
pour que tu m'aimes encore pour que tu m'aimes encore
tu m'aimes encore pour que tu m'aimes encorefade out
the whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight

staring straight back at me
why is my reflection
someone i don't know
must i pretend that i'm
someone else for all time

that burns with a need to know the reason why
why must we all conceal
what we think how we feel
must there be a secret me
i'm forced to hide
i won't pretend that i'm
someone else for all time
when will my reflection show

maybe this year will be better than the last
i can't remember all the times i tried to tell myself

step out the front door like a ghost
into the fog where noone notices
the contrast of white on white
and in between the moon and you
the angels get a better view
of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
i walk in the air between the rain
through myself and back again
where i don't know
maria says she's dying
through the door i hear her crying
why i don't know
round here we always stand up straight
round here something radiates
maria came from nashville with a suitcase in her hand
she said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like elvis
she walks along the edge where the ocean meets the land
just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
she parks her car outside of my house
says she's close to understanding jesus
she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
she has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
round here we're carving out our names
round here we all look the same
round here we talk just like lions
but we sacrifice like lambs
round here she's slipping through my hands
round here
sleeping children better run like the wind
out of the lightning dream
mama's little baby better get herself in
out of the lightning
she says "it's only in my head"
she says "shhi know it's only in my head"
but the girl on the car in the parking lot
says "man you should try to take a shot
can't you see my walls are crumbling"
then she looks up at the building
say's she's thinking of jumping
she says she's tired of life
she must be tired of something
round here she's always on my mind
round here i got lots of time
round here we're never sent to bed early
man nobody makes us wait
round here we stay up very very very very late
i i can't see nothin' nothin'
around here
you catch me if i'm falling
you catch me if i'm falling
will you catch me cause i'm falling down on you
i said i'm under the gun
around here
oh man i said i'm under the gun
around here
and i can't see nothin'nothin'
round here
well i just heard the news today
it seems my life is going to change
i closed my eyes begin to pray
then tears of joy stream down my face
with arms wide open
under the sunlight
welcome to this place
i'll show you everything
with arms wide open
with arms wide open
well i don't know if i'm ready
to be the man i have to be
i'll take a breath i'll take her by my side
we stand in awe we've created life
with arms wide open
under the sunlight
welcome to this place
i'll show you everything
with arms wide open
now everything has changed
i'll show you love
i'll show you everything
with arms wide open
if i had just one wish
only one demand
i hope he's not like me
i hope he understands
that he can take this life
and hold it by the hand
and he can greet the world
with arms wide open
with arms wide open
under the sunlight
welcome to this place
i'll show you everything
with arms wide open
now everything has changed
i'll show you love
i'll show you everything
with arms wide open
with arms wide open
i'm really close tonight
and i feel like i'm moving inside her
lying in the dark
i think that i'm beginning to know her
let it go
i'll be there when you call
whenever i fall at your feet
and you let your tears rain down on me
whenever i touch your slow turning pain
you're hiding from me now
there's something in the way that you're talking
the words don't sound right
but i hear them all moving inside you
go i'll be waiting when you call
whenever i fall at your feet
and you let your tears rain down on me
whenever i touch your slow turning pain
the finger of blame has turned upon itself
and i'm more than willing to offer myself
do you want my presence or need my help
who knows where that might lead
i fall
whenever i fall at your feet
and you let your tears rain down on me
whenever i fall at your feet
whenever i fall
end
walking 'round the room singing stormy weather
at fiftyseven mount pleasant street
wellit's the same room but everything's different
you can fight the sleep but not the dream
things ain't cookin' in my kitchen strange affliction wash over me
julius caesar and the roman empire
couldn't conquer the blue sk y
well there's a small boat made of china
it’s going nowhere on the mantlepiece
well do i lie like a loungeroom lizard
or do i sing like a bird released
everywhere you go always take the weather with you
everywhere you go always take the weather

holy infant so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace

shepherds quake at the sight
heavenly hosts from heaven above
guardian angels sing alleluia
christ our saviour is born

friday night an' i'm going nowhere
all the lights are changing green to red
turning over tv stations
situations running through my head
looking back through time you know
it's clear that i've been blind i've been a fool
to open up my heart to all that jealousy
that bitterness that ridicule
saturday i'm running wild
an' all the lights are changin' red to green
moving through the crowds i'm pushin'
chemicals are rushing in my bloodstream
only wish that you were here
you know i'm seein' it so clear i've been afraid
to show you how i really feel
admit to some of those bad mistakes i've made
and if you want it come an' get it for crying out loud
the love that i was givin' you was never in doubt
let go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now
let go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now
babylon

sunday all the lights in london shining
sky is fading red to blue
kickin' through the autumn leaves
and wonderin' where it is you might be going to
turnin' back for home you know
i'm feeling so alone i can't believe
climbin' on thestair i turn around
to see you smiling there in frontof me
and if you want it come an' get it for crying out loud
the love that i was givin' you was never in doubt
let go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now
let go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now
let go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now

sail away with me honey
i put my heart in your hands
sail away with me honey now now now
sail away with me
what will be will be
i wanna hold you now now now
crazy skies are wild above me now
winter howling at my face
and everything i held so dear
disappeared without a trace
of all the times i tasted love
never knew quite what i had
little darling if you hear me now
never needed you so bad
spinning round inside my head
sail away with me honey
i put my heart in your hands
sail away with me honey now now now
sail away with me
what will be will be
i wanna hold you now now now
i've been talking drunken gibberish
fallin' in and out of bars
trying to get some explanation here
for the way some people are
how did it ever come so far
sail away with me honey
i put my heart in your hands
sail away with me honey now now now
sail away with me
what will be will be
i wanna hold you now now now
this years love had better last
heaven knows it's high time
and i've been waiting on my own too long
but when you hold me like you do
it feels so right
i start to forget
how my heart gets torn
when that hurt gets thrown
feeling like you can't go on
turning circles when time again
it cuts like a knife oh yeah
if you love me got to know for sure
cos it takes something more this time
than sweet sweet lies
before i open up my arms and fall
losing all control
every dream inside my soul
on that midnight street
sweep me off my feet
singing ain't this life so sweet
this years love had better last
this years love had better last
'cause who's to worry
if our hearts get torn
when that hurt gets thrown
don't you know this life goes on
on that midnight street
sweep me off my feet
singing ain't this life so sweet
this years love had better last
this years love had better last
this years love had better last
this years love had better last
creole williams lived down a dirt road
made homemade wine like nobody i know
dropped by one friday night and said
can you help me creole
got a little girl waitin' on me and i
wanna treat her right he said
i got what you need son it's
sittin down in the cellar
he reached through the cobwebs
as he turned on the light and said
there might be a little dust on the bottle
but don't let it fool ya about what's inside
there might be a little dust on the bottle
it's one of those things that gets
sweeter with time
she was sittin in the
porch swing as i
pulled up the driveway
my ole heart was racing as she climbed inside
she slid over real close and
drove down to the lake road
watched the sun fade in that big red sky
i reached under the front seat and said
now here's something special
it's just been waiting for a night like tonight
there might be a little dust on the bottle
but don't let it fool ya about what's inside
there might be a little dust on the bottle
it's one of those things that gets
sweeter with time
you're still with me we made some memories
after all these years theres one thing i've found
some say good love well it's like a fine wine
it keeps getting better as the days go by
there might be a little dust on the bottle
but don't let it fool ya about what's inside
there might be a little dust on the bottle
it's one of those things that gets
sweeter with time
he was working thru college
on my grampa's farm
i was thirstin for knowledge
and he had a car
i was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
one restless summer we found love growing wild
on the banks of a river near a well beaten path
ain't it funny how those memories they last
like strawberry wine
seventeen
the hot july moon
saw everything
my first taste of love was bittersweet
like green on the vine
strawberry wine
i still remember
when thirty was old
my biggest fear was september
when he had to go
a few cards and letters and one long distance call
we drifted away like the leaves in the fall
but year after year i come back to this place
just to remember the taste of
like strawberry wine
seventeen
the hot july moon
saw everything
my first taste of love was bittersweet
like green on the vine
strawberry wine
the fields have grown over now
years since the've seen the plow
there'e nothing time hasn't touched
was it really him or the loss of my innocence
ive been missing so much
yaaaaaah
like strawberry wine
seventeen
the hot july moon
saw everything
my first taste of love was bittersweet
like green on the vine
strawberry wine
you'll say we've got nothing in common no common ground to start from
and we're falling apart
you'll say the world has come between us our lives have come between us
still i know you just don't care
and i said what about breakfast at tiffany's she said i think i remember
the film and as i recall i think we both kind of liked it and i said well that's
the one thing we've got
i see you the only one who knew me and now your eyes see through me
i guess i was wrong
so what now it's plain to see we're over and i hate when things are over
when so much is left undone

the film and as i recall i think we both kind of liked it and i said well that's

and i said what about breakfast at tiffany's she said i think i remember
the film and as i recall i think we both kind of liked it and i said well that's
the one thing we've got
walk away
if you want to
it's okay
if you need to
you can run but you can never hide
from the shadow that's creeping up beside you
there's a magic running through your soul
but you can't have it all
i'll be two steps behind you wherever you go
and i'll be there to remind you
that it only takes a minute of your precious time
to turn around
i'll be two steps behind
yeah yeah
take the time
to think about it
just walk the line you know you just can't fight it
take a look around and see what you can find
like the fire that's burning up inside me
now there's a magic running through your soul
but you can't have it all
i'll be two steps behind you wherever you go
and i'll be there to remind you
that it only takes a minute of your precious time
to turn around
i'll be two steps behind
yeah yeah
ohh
ohh there's a magic running through your soul
but you you can't have it all
i'll be two steps behind you wherever you go
and i'll be there to remind you
that it only takes a minute of your precious time
to turn around
i'll be two steps behind
yeah baby
two steps behind
ohh sugar
two steps behind
words like violence
break the silence
come crashing in
into my little world
painful to me
pierce right through me
can't you understand
oh my little girl
all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm
vows are spoken
to be broken
feelings are intense
words are trivial
pleasures remain
so does the pain
words are meaningless
and forgettable
all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm
say my name say my name
if no one is around you
say “baby i love you”
if you ain't runnin' game

in pearl jam's "immortality"
my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain cloud's up my window and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad
i drank too much last night got bills to pay my head just feels in pain
i missed the bus and there'll be hell today i'm late for work again
and even if i'm there they'll all imply that i might not last the day
and then you call me and it's not so bad it's not so bad
repeat this times as chorus instrumental verse and chorus
you can pick the right rythm for this if you look at the next verse push the door
and i want to thank you
for giving me the best day of my life
and oh just to be with you
is having the best day of my life
push the door i'm home at last and i'm soaking through and through
then you handed me a towel and all i see is you
and even if my house falls down now i wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me
and i want to thank you
for giving me the best day of my life
and oh just to be with you
is having the best day of my life
and i want to thank you
for giving me the best day of my life
and oh just to be with you
is having the best day of my life
i said i wanna touch the earth
i wanna break it in my hands
i wanna grow something wild and unruly
i wanna sleep on the hard ground
in the comfort of your arms
on a pillow of blue bonnets
in a blanket made of stars
oh it sounds good to me
cowboy take me away
fly this girl as high as you can
into the wild blue
set me free oh i pray
closer to heaven above and
closer to you
closer to you
i wanna walk and not run
i wanna skip and not fall
i wanna look at the horizon
and not see a building standing tall
i wanna be the only one
for miles and miles
except for maybe you
and your simple smile
oh it sounds good to me
yes it sounds so good to me
cowboy take me away
fly this girl as high as you can
into the wild blue
set me free oh i pray
closer to heaven above and
closer to you
closer to you
i said i wanna touch the earth
i wanna break it in my hands
i wanna grow something wild and unruly
oh it sounds so good to me
cowboy take me away
fly this girl as high as you can
into the wild blue
set me free oh i pray
closer to heaven above and
closer to you
closer to you
closer to you
cowboy take me away
closer to you
who doesn't know what i'm talking about
who's never left home who's never struck out
to find a dream and a life of their own
a place in the clouds a foundation of stone
many preceed and many will follow
a young girl's dream no longer hollow
it takes the shape of a place out west
but what it holds for her she hasn't guessed yet
she needs wide open spaces room to make her big mistakes
she needs new faces she knows the high stakes
she traveled this road as a child
wide eyed and grinning she never tired
but now she won't be coming back with the rest
if these are life's lessons she'll take this test
she needs wide open spaces room to make her big mistakes
she needs new faces she knows the high stakes she knows the high stakes
as her folks drive away her dad yells "check the oil"
mom stares out the window and says "i'm leaving my girl"
she said "it didn't seem like that long ago"
when she stood there and let her own folks know
she needed wide open spaces room to make her big mistakes
she needs new faces she knows the high stakes she knows the high stakes

november har vært her lagt igjen sludd
se solen går ned i svart hvitt
gatene her er bare brente broer
i kveld blinker byen som et mareritt
året så langt har vært bare myke pakker
er redd det er for seint til å ta det pent
glorien falmet før bladene falt
greinene visket ``jeg fikk som fortjent``
det er ikke alt jeg har sagt som er bull
hadde jeg gods skulle du fått gull
i natt
snøen laver ned
lager vi engler
og vi er i himmelen
i natt
snøen laver ned
lager vi engler
og vi er i himmelen
alle snille barn er kjøpt og betalt
på skjermen har sjarmen gått tom
gatenes løse fugler er lagt under treet
herberget er lagt ned så ingen har rom
jeg trengar noen svar så jeg ringer en svarer
stemmen lyder kjent så lenge det varer
i natt
snøen laver ned
lager vi engler
og vi er i himmelen
i natt
snøen laver ned
lager vi engler
og vi er i himmelen
face i play it like so
came in from a rainy thursday
on the avenue
thought i heard you talking softly
i turned on the lights the tv
and the radio
still i can't escape the ghost of you
what is happened to it all
crazy some say
where is the life that i recognize
gone away
but i won't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive

passion or coincidence
once prompted you to say
"pride will tear us both apart"
well now
pride's gone out the window
cross the rooftops run away
left me in the vacuum of my
heart
what is happening to me
crazy some'd say
where is my friend when i need you most
but i won't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive
papers in the roadside
tell of suffering and greed
fear today forgot tomorrow
ooh
here besides the news of
holy war and holy need
ours is just a little sorrowed
talk
and i won't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive
mmh mmh mmh mmh
go on and close the curtains 'cause all we need is candlelight
you and me and a bottle of wine
gonna hold you tonight ahyeah
well we know i'm going away and how i wish i wish it weren't so
so take this wine and drink with me
let's delay our misery
save tonight and fight the break of dawn
come tomorrow tomorrow i'll be gone
save tonight and fight the break of dawn
come tomorrow tomorrow i'll be gone

i was standing
all alone against the world outside
you were searching
for a place to hide
lost and lonely
now you've given me the will to survive
when we're hungry love will keep us alive
don't you worry sometimes
you've just gotta let it ride
the world is changing
right before your eyes
now i've found you
there's no more emptiness inside
when we're hungry
love will keep us alive
i would die for you
climb the highest mountain
baby there's nothing i wouldn't do
now i've found you
there's no more emptiness inside
when we're hungry
love will keep us alive
i would die for you
climb the highest mountain
baby there's nothing i wouldn't do
i was standing all alone
against the world outside
you were searching for a place to hide
lost and lonely now you've given me
the will to survive
when we're hungry
love will keep us alive
when we're hungry
love will keep us alive
when we're hungry
love will keep us alive
the strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
stop me and steal my breath
emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky
never revealing their depth
tell me that we belong together
dress it up with the trappings of love
i'll be captivated i'll hang from your lips
instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
and i'll be your crying shoulder
i'll be loves suicide
i'll be better when i'm older
i'll be the greatest fan of your life
rain falls angry on the tin roof
as we lie awake in my bed
you're my survival you're my living proof
my love is alive not dead
tell me that we belong together
dress it up with the trappings of love
i'll be captivated i'll hang from your lips
instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
and i'll be your crying shoulder
i'll be loves suicide
i'll be better when i'm older
i'll be the greatest fan of your life
and i've dropped out burned up
fought my way back from the dead
tuned in turned on
remembered the thing that you said
and i'll be your crying shoulder
i'll be loves suicide
i'll be better when i'm older
i'll be the greatest fan of your life
someone's always coming around here trailing some new kill
says i seen your picture on a hundred dollar bill
and what's a game of chance to you to him is one of real skill
so glad to meet you angeles
picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
go on and lose the gamble that's the history of the trade
you add up all the cards left to play to zero
and sign up with evil angeles
don't start me trying now uh huh uh huh uh huuuuuh
'cause i'm all over it angeles
i could make you satisfied in everything you do
all your secret wishes could right now be coming true
and be forever with my poison arms around you
no one's gonna fool around with us
no one's gonna fool around with us
so glad to meet you angeles
drink up baby stay up all night
with the things you could do
you won't but you might
the potential you'll be
that you'll never see
the promises you'll only make
drink up with me now
and forget all about
the pressure of days
do what i say
and i'll make you okay
and drive them away
the images stuck in your head
people you've been before
that you don't want around anymore—
that push and shove and won't bend to your will
i’ll keep them still
drink up baby look at the stars
i'll kiss you again
between the bars
where i'm seeing you there
with your hands in the air
waiting to finally be caught
drink up one more time
and i'll make you mine
keep you apart
deep in my heart
separate from the rest
where i like you the best
and keep the things you forgot
the people you've been before
that you don't want around anymore—
that push and shove and won't bend to your will
i'll keep them still

your hand on his arm
the hay stack charm around your neck
strung out and thin
calling some friend trying to cash some check
he's acting dumb
that's what you've come to expect
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
he's wearing your clothes
head down to toes a reaction to you
you say you know what he did but you idiot kid
you don't have a clue
somtimes they just get caught in the eye
you're pulling him through
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
now on the bus
nearly touching this dirty retreat
falling out and powell a dead sweat in my teeth
gonna walk walk walk
four more blocks plus the one in my break
down downstairs to the man
he's gonna make it all ok
i can't beat myself
i can't beat myself
and i don't want to talk
i'm taking the cure so i can be quiet
whenever i want
so leave me alone
you ought to be proud that i'm getting good marks
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
needle in the hay
i'm in love with the world
through the eyes of a girl
who's still around the morning after
we broke up a month ago
i grew up i didn't know
i'd be around the morning after
it's always been wait and see
a happy day and then you pay
and feel like shit the morning after
but now i feel changed around
and instead falling down
i'm standing up the morning after
situtations get fucked up
but turned around sooner or laaaaa ter
i could be another fool
an exception to the rule
you tell me the morning after
crooked spin can't come to rest
i'm damaged bad at best
she'll decide what she wants
i'll probably be the last to know
no one says until it shows
and you see how it iiiiiiiis
they want you or they don't
say yes
i'm in love with the world
through the eyes of a girl
who's still around the morning after

g bars
first the mic then a half cigarette
singing "cathy's clown"
that's the man she's married to now
that's the girl that he takes around town
she appears composed so she is i suppose
who can really tell
she shows no emotion at all
stares into space like a dead china doll
i'm never gonna know you now but i'm gonna love you anyhow
g bars
now she's done and they're calling someone
such a familiar name
i'm so glad that my memory's remote
cos i'm doing just fine hour to hour note to note
here it is the revenge to the tune
you're no good
you're no good you're no good you're no good
can't you tell that it's well understood
i'm never gonna know you now but i'm gonna love you anyhow
i'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on
i'm tired
i'm tired
looking out on the substitute scene
still going strong
xo mom
it's okay its alright nothing's wrong
tell mr man with impossible plans
to just leave me alone
in the place where i make no mistakes
in the place where i have what it takes
i'm never gonna know you now but i'm gonna love you anyhow
i'm never gonna know you now but i'm gonna love you anyhow
i'm never gonna know you now but i'm gonna love you anyhow
there was a time
i was everything and
nothing all in one
when you found me
i was feeling like a
cloud across the sun
i need to tell you
how you light up
every second of the day
but in the moonlight
you just shine
like a beacon on the bay
and i can't explain
but it's something about
the way you look tonight
takes my breath away
it's that feeling i get about
you deep inside
and i can't describe
but it's something about
the way you look tonight
takes my breath away
the way you look tonight
with a smile
you pull the deepest
secrets from my heart
in all honesty
i'm speechless and i
don't know where to start
and i can't explain
but it's something about
the way you look tonight
takes my breath away
it's that feeling i get about
you deep inside
and i can't describe
but it's something about
the way you look tonight
takes my breath away
the way you look tonight
the way you look tonight x
the way you look tonight
she may be the face i can't forget
the trace of pleasure or regret
maybe my treasure or the price i have to pay
she may be the song that summer sings
may be the chill that autumn brings
may be a hundred different things
within the measure of a day
she may be the beauty or the beast
may be the famine or the feast
may turn each day into a heaven or a hell
she may be the mirror of my dreams
a smile reflected in a stream
she may not be what she may seem
inside her shell
she who always seems so happy in a crowd
whose eyes can be so private and so proud
no one's allowed to see them when they cry
she maybe the love that cannot hope to last
may come to me from shadows in the past
that i remember till the day i die
she maybe the reason i survive
the why and wherefore i'm alive
the one i care for through the rough and ready years
me i'll take the laughter and her tears
and make them all my souvenirs
for where she goes i've got to be
the meaning of my life is
sheshe
oh she
kamukha mo si paraluman
nung tayo ay bata pa
at ang galinggaling mo sumayaw
mapa boogie man o chacha
ngunit ang paborito
ay pagsayaw mo ng el bimbo
nakakaindak nakakaaliw
nakakatindig balahibo
pagkagaling sa skwela ay didiretso na sa inyo
at buong maghapon ay tinuturuan mo ako
magkahawak ang ating kamay
at walang kamalaymalay
na tinuruan mo ang puso ko
na umibig ng tunay
naninigas ang aking katawan
pagumikot na ang plaka
patay sa kembot ng bewang mo
at ang pungay ng iyong mga mata
lumiliwanag ang buhay
habang tayo'y magkaakbay
at dahandahang dumudulas
ang kamay ko sa makinis mong braso
sana noon pa man ay sinabi na sa iyo
kahit hindi na uso ay ito lang ang alam ko
magkahawak ang ating kamay
at walang kamalaymalay
na tinuruan mo ang puso ko
na umibig ng tunay
la la la la
la la
la la
la la la la
lumipas ang maraming taon
di na tayo nagkita
balita ko'y may anak ka na
ngunit walang asawa
tagahugas ka raw ng pinggan
sa may ermita
at isang gabi nasagasaan
sa isang madilim na eskinita
lahat ng pangarap ko'y bigla lang natunaw
sa panaginip na lang pala kita maisasayaw
magkahawak ang ating kamay
at walang kamalaymalay
na tinuruan mo ang puso ko
na umibig ng tunay
magkahawak ang ating kamay
at walang kamalaymalay
na tinuruan mo ang puso ko
na umibig ng tunay
la la la la

la la la la
ooh

pare ko meron akong prublema
'wag mo sabihing "na naman"
inlab ako sa isang kolehiyala
hindi ko maintindihan
wag na nating idaan sa "maboteng" usapan
lalu lang madaragdagan ang sakit ng ulo at bilbil sa tiyan
anong sarap kami'y naging magkaibigan
napuno ako ng pagasa
yun pala hanggang dun lang ang kaya
akala ko ay puwede pa
masakit mang isipin kailangang tanggapin
kung kelan ka naging siryoso saka ka niya gagaguhin
o diyos ko ano ba naman ito
di ba 'tangina nagmukha akong tanga
pinaasa niya lang ako
letseng pagibig 'to
diyos ko ano ba naman ito woh
sabi niya ayaw niya munang magkasyota
dehins ako naniwala
di nagtagal naging ganun na rin ang tema
kulang na lang ay sagot niya
ba't ba ang labo niya di ko maipinta
hanggang kelan maghihintay ako ay nabuburat na
pero minamahal ko siya
di biro tl ako sa kanya
alam kong nababaduyan ka na sa mga sinasabi ko
pero sana naman ay maintindihan mo
o pare ko o pare ko meron ka bang maipapayo
kung wala ay okey lang kung wala ay okey lang
kailangan lang ay kailangan lang ang iyong pakikiramay
nandito ka ay ayos na nandito ka ay ayos na
masakit mang isipin kailangang tanggapin
kung kelan ka naging seryoso saka ka niya gagaguhin
o diyos ko ano ba naman ito
di ba 'tangina nagmukha akong tanga
pinaasa niya lang ako
letseng pagibig 'to
diyos ko ano ba naman ito woh
o diyos ko ano ba naman ito
di ba 'tangina nagmukha akong tanga
pinaasa niya lang ako
letseng pagibig 'to
diyos ko ano ba naman ito woh

lift your head baby don't be scared
of the things that could go wrong along the way
you'll get by with a smile
you can't win at everything but you can try
baby you don't have to worry
'coz there ain't no need to hurry
no one ever said that there's an easy way
when they're closing all their doors
and they don't want you anymore
this sounds funny but i'll say it anyway
girl i'll stay through the bad times
even if i have to fetch you every day
i'll get by if you smile
you can never be too happy in this life
in a world where everybody
hates a happy ending story
it's a wonder love can make this world go 'round
and don't let it bring you down
and turn your face into a frown
you'll get along with a little prayer and a song
to doo doo doo let me hear you sing it
to doo doo doo
in a world where everybody
hates a happy ending story
it's a wonder love can make the world go 'round
but don't let it bring you down
and turn your face into a frown
you'll get along with a little prayer and a song
lift your head baby don't be scared
of the things that could go wrong along the way
you'll get by with a smile
now it's time to kiss away those tears goodbye

the falling leaves drift by my window
the falling leaves of red and gold then slide up frets and back to am
i see your lips the summer kisses
the sunburned hands i used to hold
since you went away the days grow long
and soon i'll hear old winter's song
but i miss you most of all my darling
when autumn leaves start to fall slide up frets then back to am
slow picking
since you went away the days grow long
and soon i'll hear old winter's song
but i miss you most of all my darling
when autumn leaves start to fall slide up frets then back to am
yes i miss you most of all my darling
when autumn leaves start to fall slide up frets then back to am
ooo ooo ooo ooo
you'll remember me when the west wind moves
among the fields of barley
you can tell the sun in his jealous sky
when we walked in fields of gold
so she took her love
for to gaze awhile
among the fields of barley
in his arms she fell as her hair came down
among the fields of gold
will you stay with me
will you be my love
among the fields of barley
and you can tell the sun in his jealous sky
when we walked in fields of gold
i never made promises lightly
and there have been some that i have broken
but i swear in the days still left
we will walk in fields of gold
we will walk in fields of gold
i never made promises lightly
and there have been some that i have broken
but i swear in the days still left
we will walk in fields of gold
we will walk in fields of gold
ooo ooo ooo
many years have passed since those summer days
among the fields of barley
see the children run as the sun goes down
as you lie in fields of gold
you'll remember me when the west wind moves
among the fields of barley
you can tell the sun in his jealous sky
when we walked in fields of gold
when we walked in fields of gold
when we walked in fields of gold
somewhere over the rainbow way up high
in the land that i heard of once in a lullaby
somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
someday i'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
where troubles melt like lemon drops
away above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me
somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
if happy little bluebirds fly
above the rainbow why oh why can't i

e|xxxxx|
for you there'll be no crying
for you the sun will be shining
'cause i feel that when i'm with you
it's alright
i know it's alright
and the songbirds keep singing like they know the score
and i love you i love you i love you
like never before
to you i would give the world
to you i'd never be cold
'cause i feel that when i'm with you
it's alright
i know it's alright
and the songbirds keep singing like they know the score
and i love you i love you i love you
like never before
like never before
like never before
i would swallow my pride
i would choke on the rinds
but the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
i would swallow my doubt turn it inside out
want to put my tender heart in a blender
watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
rendezvous then i'm through with you
i burn burn like a wicker cabinet chalk white and oh so frail
i see our time had gotten stale
the tick tock of the clock is painful
all sane and logical
i want to tear it off the wall
i hear words and clips and phrases
i think sick like ginger ale
my stomach turns and i exhale
i would swallow my pride
i would choke on the rinds
but the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
i would swallow my doubt turn it inside out
want to put my tender heart in a blender
watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
rendezvous then i'm through with you
so cal is where my mind states
but it's not my state of mind
i'm not as ugly sad as you
or am i origami
folded up and just pretend
demented as the motives in your head
i would swallow my pride
i would choke on the rinds
but the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
i would swallow my doubt turn it inside out
want to put my tender heart in a blender
watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
rendezvous then i'm through with you
i alone am the one you don't know you need take heed feed your ego
make me blind when your eyes close sink when you get close tie me to the
i alone am the one you don't know you need you don't know you need me
make me blind when your eyes close tie me to the bed post
i would swallow my pride
i would choke on the rinds
but the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
i would swallow my doubt turn it inside out
find nothing but faith in nothing
want to put my tender heart in a blender
watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
rendezvous then i'm through with you
through with you
rendezvous then i'm through with you
i am still living with your ghost
lonely and dreaming of the west coast
i don't want to be your downtime
i don't want to be your stupid game
with my big black boots and an old suitcase
i do believe i'll find myself a new place
i don't want to be the bad guy
i don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore
we can live beside the ocean
leave the fire behind
swim out past the breakers
watch the world die
i am still dreaming of your face
hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
i don't want to be your good time
i don't want to be your fallback crutch anymore
i'll walk right out into a brand new day
insane and rising in my own weird way
i don't want to be the bad guy
i don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore
we can live beside the ocean
leave the fire behind
swim out past the breakers
watch the world die

we've all seen a man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
the hair on his face is dirty dreadlocked and full of mange
he asks a man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
"get a job you fucking slob" is all he replies
god forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
'cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues
then you really might know what it's like what it's like
then you really might know what it's like what it's like
then you really might know what it's like what it's like
then you really might know what it's like
mary got pregnant from a kid named tom that said he was in love
he said "don't worry about a thing baby doll i'm the man you've been dreaming of"
but months later he say he won't date her or return her calls
and she swear "god damn if i find that man i'm cuttin' off his balls"
and then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walking through the door
they call her a killer and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore
god forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
'cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose
then you really might know what it's like what it's like
then you really might know what it's like what it's like
then you really might know what it's like what it's like
then you really might know what it's like
i've seen a rich man beg i've seen a good man sin i've seen a tough man cry
i've seen a loser win and a sad man grin i heard an honest man lie
i've seen the good side of bad and the downside of up and everything between
i licked the silver spoon drank from the golden cup and smoked the finest green
i stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times before i broke their heart
you know where it ends it usually depends on where you start
i knew this kid named max who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
he liked to hang out late he liked to get shitfaced and keep the pace with thugs
until late one night there was a big old fight and max lost his head
he pulled out his chrome talked some shit and wound up dead
now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain
you know it comes that way at least that's what they say when you play the game
god forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
'cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
then you really might know what it's like what it's like
then you really might know what it's like what it's like
then you really might know what it's like what it's like
then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
love of my life you've hurt me
you've broken my heart and now you leave me
love of my life can't you see
bring it back bring it back
don't take it away from me because
you don't know
what it means to me
love of my life don't leave me
you've taken my love and now desert me
love of my life can't you see
bring it back bring it back
don't take it away from me because
you don't know

it's not that i want you
not to say but if you only knew
hoow easy
it would be to show me how you feel
more than words is all you have to do
to make it real
then you wouldn't have to say
that you love me 'cos
i'd already know
what would you do if my heart was torn in two
more than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
what would you say if i took those words away
then you couldn't make things new
just by saying i love you
now that i've tried to
talk to you and make you understand
all that you have to do is
close your eyes and just reach out your hands
and touch me
hold me close don't ever let me go
more than words
is all i ever needed you to show
then you wouldn't have to say
that you love me 'cos
i'd already know
what would you do if my heart was torn in two
more than words to show you feel that your love for me is real

they made up their minds
and they started packing
they left before the sun came up that day
an exit to eternal summer slacking
but where were they going without ever
knowing the way
they drank up the wine
and they got to talking
they now had more important things to say
when the car broke down they started walking
where were they going without even
knowing the way
anyone can see the road that they walk on
is paved with gold
it's always summer
they'll never get cold
they'll never get hungry
they'll never get old and grey
you can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
they won't make it home
but they really don't care
they wanted the highway
they're happier there today
their children woke up
and they couldn't find them
they left before the sun came up that day
they just drove off and left it all behind'em
but where were they going without ever
knowing the way
anyone can see the road that they walk on
is paved with gold
it's always summer
they'll never get cold
they'll never get hungry
they'll never get old and grey
you can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
they won't make it home
but they really don't care
they wanted the highway
they're happier there today
anyone can see the road that they walk on

i've been a bad bad girl
i've been careless with a delicate man
and it's a sad sad world
when a girl can break a boy
just because she can
don't you tell me to deny it
i've done wrong and i want to
suffer for my sins
i've come to you cause i need
guidance to be true
and i just don't know where i can begin
what i need is a good defense
cause i'm feelin' like a criminal
and i need to be redeemed
to the one i sinned against
because he was all i ever knew of love
heaven help me for the way i am
save me from these evil deeds
before i get them done
i know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
but i keep livin' this day like
the next will never come
oh help me but don't tell me to deny it
i've got to cleanse myself
of all these lies till i'm good enough for him
i've got a lot to lose and i'm bettin' high
so i'm beggin' you before it ends
just tell me where to begin
what i need is a good defense
cause i'm feelin' like a criminal
and i need to be redeemed
to the one i sinned against
because he was all i ever knew of love
let me know the way
before there's hell to pay
give me room to lay the law and let me go
i've got to make a play
to make my lover stay
so what would an angel say
cause the devil wants to know
what i need is a good defense
cause i'm feelin' like a criminal
and i need to be redeemed
to the one i sinned against
because he was all i ever knew of love
what i need is a good defense
cause i'm feelin' like a criminal
and i need to be redeemed
to the one i sinned against
because he was all i ever knew of loooooooooooove love
i was staring at the sky just looking for a star
to pray on or wish on or something like that
i was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
whose reality i knew was a hopeless to be had
but then the dove of hope began its downward slope
and i believed for a moment that my chances
were approaching to be grabbed
but as it came down near so did a weary tear
i thought it was a bird but it was just a paper bag
hunger hurts and i want him so bad oh it kills
'cause i know i'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
i got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
hunger hurts but starving works when it costs too much to love
and i went crazy again today
looking for a strand to climb looking for a little hope
baby said he couldn't stay wouldn't put his lips to mine
and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
i said 'honey i don't feel so good don't feel justified
come on put a little love here in my void'
he said'it's all in your head'
and i said 'so's everything' but he didn't get it
i thought he was a man
but he was just a little boy
hunger hurts and i want him so bad oh it kills
'cause i know i'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
i got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
hunger hurts but starving works when it costs too much to love
hunger hurts but i want him so bad oh it kills
'cause i know i'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
i got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
hunger hurts but starving works when when it costs too much to love
oh hunger hurts and i want him so bad oh it kills
because i know i'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
i got to fold 'cause these hands are just too shaky to hold
hunger hurts but starving it works when it costs too much to love
if i ever leave this world alive
i'll thank ya' for things you did in my life
i'll come back down and sit beside your feet tonight
wherever i am you'll always be
more than just a memory
if i ever leave this world alive
if i ever leave this world alive
i'll take on all the sadness that i left behind
the madness that you feel will soon subside
so in a word don't shed a tear
i'll be here when it all gets weird
if i ever leave this world alive
e||
so when in doubt just call my name
just before you go insane
if i ever leave this world
hey i may never leave this world
but if i ever leave this world aliveshe says
i'm okay i'm alright
though you have gone from my life
you said that it would
now everything should
be alright

looking for a sign of life
looking for something to help me burn out bright

looking 'cause i'm tired of lying
make my way back home and learn to fly

it could wait one night
give it all away if you give me one last try
we'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
run and tell the angels that everything's alright

looking for a sign of life
looking for something to help me burnout bright
i'm looking for a complication

i'm sitting here in a boring room
it's just another rainy sunday afternoon
i'm wasting my time i got nothing to do
i'm hanging around i'm waiting for you
but nothing ever happens and i wonder
i'm driving around in my car
i'm driving too fast i'm driving too far
i'd like to change my point of view
i feel so lonely i'm waiting for you
but nothing ever happens and i wonder
i wonder how i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemontree
i'm turning my head up and down
i'm turning turning turning turning turning around
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemontree
dadada
i'm sitting here i miss the power
i'd like to go out taking a shower
but there's a heavy cloud inside my head
i feel so tired put myself into bed
where nothing ever happens and i wonder
isolation is not good for me
isolation i don't want to sit on a lemontree
i'm steppin' around in a desert of joy
baby anyhow i'll get another toy
and everything will happen and you'll wonder
i wonder how i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemontree
i'm turning my head up and down
i'm turning turning turning turning turning around
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemontree
and i wonder i wonder
i wonder how i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see
and all that i can see
and all that i can see

depuis le temps que je patiente
dans cette chambre noire
j'entends qu'on s'amuse et qu'on chante
au bout du couloir
quelqu'un a touché le verrou
et j'ai plongé vers le grand jour
j'ai vu les fanfares les barrières
et les gens autour
dans les premiers moments j'ai cru
qu'il fallait seulement se défendre
mais cette place est sans issue
je commence à comprendre
ils ont refermé derrière moi
ils ont eu peur que je recule
je vais bien finir par l'avoir
cette danseuse ridicule
estce que ce monde est sérieux
estce que ce monde est sérieux
andalousie je me souviens
les prairies bordées de cactus
je ne vais pas trembler devant
ce pantin ce minus
je vais l'attraper lui et son chapeau
les faire tourner comme un soleil
ce soir la femme du torero
dormira sur ses deux oreilles
estce que ce monde est sérieux
estce que ce monde est sérieux
j'en ai poursuivi des fantômes
presque touché leurs ballerines
ils ont frappé fort dans mon cou
pour que je m'incline
ils sortent d'où ces acrobates
avec leurs costumes de papier
j'ai jamais appris à me battre
contre des poupées
sentir le sable sous ma tête
c'est fou comme ça peut faire du bien
j'ai prié pour que tout s'arrête
andalousie je me souviens
je les entends rire comme je râle
je les vois danser comme je succombe
je pensais pas qu'on puisse autant
s'amuser autour d'une tombe
estce que ce monde est sérieux
estce que ce monde est sérieux
si si hombre hombre baila baila
hay que bailar de nuevo
y mataremos otros
otras vidas otros toros
y mataremos otros
venga venga a bailar
y mataremos otros
le le le oh oh oh
out here barely see my breath
surrounded by jealousy and death
i can't be reached only had one call
dragged underneath separate from you all
you all
this time lost my own return
in spite of everything i've learned
i hid my tracks spit out all my air
slipped into cracks stripped of all my cares
my cares
e||
i'm so tired sheep are counting me
no more struggle no more energy
no more patient and you can write that down
it's all too crazy and i'm not sticking round
strumming my pain with his fingers singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song
i heard he sang a good song
i heard he had a style
and so i came to see him
and listen for a while
and there he was this young boy
a stranger to my eyes
strumming my pain with his fingers singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song
i felt all flushed with fever
embarrassed by the crowd
i felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud
i prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on
strumming my pain with his fingers singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song
strumming my pain with his fingers singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song


blame it all on my roots
i showed up in boots
and ruined your black tie affair
the last one to know
the last one to show
i was the last one you thought you'd see there
and i saw the surprise
and the fear in his eyes
when i took his glass of champagne
i toasted you
said honey we may be through
but you'll never hear me
complain
'cause i got friends in low places
where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
my blues away
and i'll be okay
i'm not big on social graces
think i'll slip on down to the oasis
'cause i've got friends
in low places
well i guess i was wrong
i just don't belong
but then i've been there before
everything's alright
i'll just say goodnight
and i'll show myself to the door
hey i didn't mean
to cause a big scene
just give me an hour and then
i'll be as high as that
ivory tower
that you're livin'
in
'cause i got friends in low places
where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
my blues away
and i'll be okay
i'm not big on social graces
think i'll slip on down to the oasis
'cause i've got friends
in low places
i guess i was wrong
i just don't belong
but then i've been there before
and everything's alright
i'll just say goodnight
and i'll show myself to the door
i didn't mean
to cause a big scene
just wait 'til i finish this glass
then sweet little lady
i'll head back to the bar
and you can
kiss my ass
'cause i got friends in low places
where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
my blues away
and i'll be okay
i'm not big on social graces
think i'll slip on down to the oasis
'cause i've got friends
in low places
o little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight
oh holy child of bethlehem
descend to us we pray
cast out our sins and enter in
be born to us today
oh morning stars together
proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth
you know a dream is like a river ever changing as it flows
and a dreamer's just a vessel that must follow where it goes
trying to learn from what's behind him
and never knowing what's in store
makes each day a constant battle
just to stay between the shores
and i will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry
like a bird upon the wind these waters are my sky
i'll never reach my destination if i never try
so i will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry
too many times we stand aside and let the waters slip away
'til what we put off 'til tomorrow has now become today
so don't you sit upon the shoreline and say you're satisfied
choose to chance the rapids and dare to dance the tide
and i will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry
like a bird upon the wind these waters are my sky
i'll never reach my destination if i never try
so i will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry
and there's bound to be rough waters
and i know i'll take some falls
but with the good lord as my captain
i can make it through them all
and i will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry
like a bird upon the wind these waters are my sky
i'll never reach my destination if i never try
so i will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry
yes i will sail my vessel
'til the river runs dry
'til the river runs dry
threethirty in the morning not a soul in sight
the city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
raindrops on the windshield there's a storm moving in
he's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been
and the thunder rolls and the thunder rolls
every light is burnin' in a house across town
she's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
askin' for a miracle hopin' she's not right
prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night
and the thunder rolls and the thunder rolls
and the thunder rolls and the lightnin' strikes
another love grows cold on a sleepless night
as the storm blows on out of control
deep in her heart the thunder rolls
she's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
she rushes out to hold him thankful he's alive
but on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
and the lightnin' flashes in her eyes and he knows that she knows
and the thunder rolls and the thunder rolls
and the thunder rolls and the lightnin' strikes
another love grows cold on a sleepless night
as the storm blows on out of control
deep in her heart the thunder rolls
she runs back down the hallway to the bedroom door
she reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
tells the lady in the mirror he won't do this again
cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been
and the thunder rolls and the thunder rolls
and the thunder rolls and the lightnin' strikes
another love grows cold on a sleepless night
as the storm blows on out of control
deep in her heart the thunder rolls
used to be so easy to give my heart away
but i found out the hard way there a price you have to pay
e|||
used to be so easy to give my heart away
but i've found that the hard way is a price you have to pay
i found that love was no friend of mine
i should have known time after time
so long it was so long ago
used to be so easy to fall in love again
i've found that the hard way it's a way that leads to pain
i've found that love was more than just a game
to play and to win but to lose just the same
so long it was so long ago
so many years since i've seen your face
and now in my heart there's an empty space
you used to be
so long it was so long ago
but i've still got the blues for you
though the days come and go there's one thing i know
c a g
isn't it a pity
now isn't it a shame
how we break each other's hearts
and cause each other pain
how we take each other's love
without thinking anymore
forgetting to give back
isn't it a pity
some things take so long
but how do i explain
when not too many people
can see we're all the same
and because of all their tears
their eyes can't hope to see
the beauty that surrounds them
isn't it a pity
isn't it a pity
now isn't it a shame
how we break each other's hearts
and cause each other pain
how we take each other's love
without thinking anymore
forgetting to give back
isn't it a pity
forgetting to give back
isn't it a pity
forgetting to give back
now isn't it a pity
forgetting to give back
now isn't it a pity
oh what a pity
what a pity pity pity
oh what a pity
what a pity pity pity
na na na na na na na
na na na na isn't it a pity
na na na na na na na
na na na na isn't it a pity
it started way back in third grade

a pink dress matching bow and her pony tail

we came we came we came again
so you wanna spin the world around
so you wanna spin the world around
and anybody else cut 'em down
so you wanna make catastrophe
and i'd give up forever to touch you
'cause i know that you feel me somehow
you're the closest to heaven that i'll ever be
and i don't want to go home right now
and all i can taste is this moment
and all i can breathe is your life
and sooner or later it's over
i just don't want to miss you tonight
and i don't want the world to see me
'cause i don't think that they'd understand
when everything's made to be broken
i just want you to know who i am
and you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
or the moment of truth in your lies
when everything feels like the movies
yeah you bleed just to know you're alive
and i don't want the world to see me
'cause i don't think that they'd understand
when everything's made to be broken
i just want you to know who i am
and i don't want the world to see me
'cause i don't think that they'd understand
when everything's made to be broken
i just want you to know who i am
and i don't want the world to see me
'cause i don't think that they'd understand
when everything's made to be broken
i just want you to know who i am
i just want you to know who i am
i just want you to know who i am
i just want you to know who i am
and even though the moment passed me by
i still can't turn away
cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
got tossed along the way
and letters that you never meant to send
get lost or thrown away
and now we're grown up orphans
that never knew their names
we don't belong to no one
that's a shame
but you could hide beside me
maybe for a while
and i won't tell no one your name
and i won't tell em your name
scars are souvenirs you never lose
the past is never far
did you lose yourself somewhere out there
did you get to be a star
and don't it make you sad to know that life
is more than who we are
you grew up way too fast
and now there's nothing to believe
and reruns all become our history
a tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
and i won't tell no one your name
and i won't tell em your name
and i won't tell em your name
oooooh mmmm mmmm
and i won't tell em your name
i think about you all the time
but i don't need the same
it's lonely where you are come back down
and i won't tell em your name


could you whisper in my ear
the things you wanna feel
i'd give you anythin'
do you wake up on your own
and wonder where you are
you live with all your faults


so why don't you slide
yeah i'm gonna let it slide
don't you love the life you killed
the priest is on the phone
your father hit the wall
don't supposed i'll ever know
what it means to be a man
it's somethin' i can't change
so why don't you slide
and i'll do anything
you ever dreamed to be complete
little pieces of the nothin that fall
oh may
put your arms around me
what you feel is what you are
and what you are is beautiful
oh may
do you wanna get married
or run away
e||

bring me home to this house of many days
just lay me on the floor hard and cool as slate
you know i love it more and more than before i ran away
it triggers off so many hurts hurtful words and broken plates
i lied to
now i'm fuzzy
i've been lied to
all and all the world is small enough for both of us
e||
d
do you have the time
to listen to me whine
about nothing and everything
all at once
i am one of those
melodramatic fools
neurotic to the bone
no doubt about it
sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think i'm cracking up
am i just paranoid
am i just stoned
i went to a shrink
to analyze my dreams
she says it's lack of sex
that's bringing me down
i went to a whore
he said my life's a bore
so quit my whining cause
it's bringing her down
sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think i'm cracking up
am i just paranoid
uh yuh yuh ya
grasping to control
so i better hold on
sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think i'm cracking up
am i just paranoid
am i just stoned
i'm having trouble trying to sleep
i'm counting sheep but running out
as time ticks by
and still i try
no rest for crosstops in my mind
on my own here we go
my eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
dried up and bulging out my skull
my mouth is dry
my face is numb
fd up and spun out in my room
on my own here we go
my mind is set on overdrive
the clock is laughing in my face
a crooked spine
my sense's dulled
passed the point of delirium
on my own here we go
my eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
dried up and bulging out my skull
my mouth is dry
my face is numb
fd up and spun out in my room
on my own here we go
another turning point a fork stuck in the road
time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go
so make the best of this test and don't ask why
it's not a question but a lesson learned in time
it's something unpredictable but in the end it's right
i hope you had the time of your life
so take the photographs and still frames in your mind
hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
for what it's worth it was worth all the while
it's something unpredictable but in the end it's right
i hope you had the time of your life
it's something unpredictable but in the end it's right
i hope you had the time of your life
it's something unpredictable but in the end it's right
i hope you had the time of your life
she she screams in silence a sullen riot penetrating through her mind
waiting for a sign to smash the silence with a brick of self control
are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you
are you feeling like a social tool without a use
scream at me until my ears bleed i'm taking heed just for you
she she's figured out all her doubts were someone else's point of view
waking up this time to smash the silence with a brick of self control
are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you
are you feeling like a social tool without a use
scream at me until my ears bleed i'm taking heed just for you
are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you
are you feeling like a social tool without a use
scream at me until my ears bleed i'm taking heed just for you
i heard you crying loud
all the way across town
you've been searching for that someone
and it's me out on the prowl
as you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
well don't get lonely now
and dry your whining eyes
i'm just roaming for the moment
sleazin' my back yard so don't get
so uptight you been thinking about ditching me
no time to search the world around
cause you know where i'll be found
i heard it all before
so don't knock down my door
i'm a loser and a user so i don't need no accuser
to try and slag me down because i know you're right
so go do what you like
make sure you do it wise
you may find out that your self doubt
means nothing was ever there
you can't go forcing something
if it's just not right
no time to search the world around
cause you know where i'll be found

no time to search the world around
cause you know where i'll be found
when i come around
when i come around
look at your young men fighting
look at your women crying
look at your young men dying
the way they've always done before
look at the hate we're breeding
look at the fear we're feeding
look at the lives we're leading
the way we've always done before
my hands are tied
the billions shift from side to side
and the wars go on with brainwashed pride
for the love of god and our human rights
and all these things are swept aside
by bloody hands time can't deny
and are washed away by your genocide
and history hides the lies of our civil wars
d'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
who said "peace could last forever"
and in my first memories they shot kennedy
i went numb when i learned to see so i never fell for vietnam
we got the wall of dc to remind us all that you can't trust freedom
when it's not in your hands when everybody's fightin'
for their promised land and
i don't need your civil war
it feeds the rich while it buries the poor
you're power hungry sellin' soldier in a human grocery store ain't that fresh
i don't need your civil war
look at the shoes you're filling
look at the blood we're spilling
look at the world we're killing
the way we've always done before
look in the doubt we've wallowed
look at the leaders we've followed
look at the lies we've swallowed
and i don't want to hear no more
my hands are tied
for all i've seen has changed my mind
but still the wars go on and the years go by
with no love of god or human rights 'cause all these dreams are swept aside
by bloody hands of the hypnotized
who carry the cross of homicide
and history bears the scars of our civil wars
i don't need your civil war
it feeds the rich while it buries the poor
you're power hungry sellin' soldier in a human grocery store ain't that fresh
i don't need your civil war
i don't need your civil war
i don't need your civil war
you're power hungry sellin' soldier in a human grocery store ain't that fresh
i don't need your civil war
i don't need one more war
i don't need one more war
mama take this badge from me
i can't use it anymore
it's getting dark too dark to see
feels like i'm knockin' on heaven's door
knockknockknockin' on heaven's door hey hey heyhey
yeah knockknockknockin' on heaven's door
knockknockknockin' on heaven's door ooohoh
yeah knockknockknockin' on heaven's doorohwhoa yeahyeahyeah

knockknockknockin' on heaven's door hey hey heyhey
yeah knockknockknockin' on heaven's door
knockknockknockin' on heaven's door ohh
yeah knockknockknockin' on heaven's doorohwhoa yeahyeahyeah
when i look into your eyes
i can see a love restrained
but darling when i hold you
don't you know i feel the same
cause nothin' lasts forever
and we both know hearts can change
and it's hard to hold a candle
in the cold november rain
we've been through this such a long long time
just tryin' to kill the pain oh yeah
but lovers always come and lovers always go
and no one's really sure who's lettin' go today walkin' away
if we could take the time to lay it on the line
i could rest my head
just knowin' that you were mine all mine
so if you want to love me
then darlin' don't refrain
or i'll just end up walkin'
in the cold november rain
do you need some time on your own
do you need some time all alone
everybody needs some time on their own
don't you know you need some time all alone
i know it's hard to keep an open heart
when even friends seem out to harm you
but if you could heal a broken heart
wouldn't time be out to charm you
sometimes i need some time on my own
sometimes i need some time all alone
everybody needs some time on their own
don't you know you need some time all alone
and when your fears subside
and shadows still remain oh yeah
i know that you can love me
when there's no one left to blame
so never mind the darkness
we still can find a way
cause nothin' lasts forever
even cold november rain
don't you you think that you need somebody
don't you think that you need someone
everybody needs somebody you're not the only one you're not the only one
je vraagt of ik zin heb in een sigaret
het is twee uur 's nachts we liggen op bed
in een hotel in een stad waar niemand ons hoort
waar niemand ons kent en niemand ons stoort
op de vloer ligt een lege fles wijn
en kledingstukken die van jou of mij kunnen zijn
een schemering de radio zacht
en deze nacht heeft alles wat ik van een nacht verwacht
het is een nacht die je normaal alleen in films ziet
het is een nacht die wordt bezongen in het mooiste lied
het is een nacht waarvan ik dacht dat ik hem nooit beleven zou
maar vannacht beleef ik hem met jou
oh oh oh oh oh
ik ben nog wakker en ik staar naar het plafond
en ik denk aan hoe de dag lang geleden begon
het zomaar ervandoor gaan met jou
niet wetend waar de reis eindigen zou
nu lig ik hier in een wild vreemde stad
en heb net de nacht van mijn leven gehad
maar helaas er komt weer licht door de ramen
hoewel voor ons de wereld vannacht heeft stil gestaan
het is een nacht die je normaal alleen in films ziet
het is een nacht die wordt bezongen in het mooiste lied
het is een nacht waarvan ik dacht dat ik hem nooit beleven zou
maar vannacht beleef ik hem met jou
oh oh oh oh oh
maar een lied blijft slechts bij woorden
een film is in scène gezet
maar deze nacht met jou
is levensecht
het is een nacht die je normaal alleen in films ziet
het is een nacht die wordt bezongen in het mooiste lied
het is een nacht waarvan ik dacht dat ik hem nooit beleven zou
maar vannacht beleef ik hem met jou
oh oh oh oh oh
ja vannacht beleef ik hem met jou
oh oh oh oh oh
en ik hou alleen nog maar van jou
oh oh oh oh

in the end they’ll be the only ones there
when you get old and start losing your hair

i had visions i was in them i was looking into the mirror
to see a little bit clearer the rottenness and evil in me
fingertips have memories mine can't forget the curves of your body
and when i feel a bit naughty i run it up the flagpole and see
i'm not sick but i'm not well and i'm so hot cause i'm in hell
been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding
the cretins cloning and feeding and i don't even own a tv
put me in the hospital for nerves and then they had to commit me
you told them all i was crazy they cut off my legs now
i'm not sick but i'm not well and i'm so hot cause i'm in hell
i'm not sick but i'm not well and it's a sin to live so well
i wanna publish 'zines and rage against machines
i wanna pierce my tongue it doesn't hurt it feels fine
the trivial sublime i'd like to turn off time
and kill my mind you kill my mind
paranoia paranoia everybody's comin' to get me
just say you never met me i'm going underground with the moles digging holes
hear the voices in my head i swear to god it sounds like they're snoring
but if you're bored then you're boring the agony and the irony
i'm not sick but i'm not well and i'm so hot cause i'm in hell
i'm not sick but i'm not well and it's a sin to live so well

im wagen vor mir fährt ein junges mädchen
sie fährt allein und sie scheint hübsch zu sein
ich weiss nicht ihren namen und ich kenne nicht ihr ziel
ich merke nur sie fährt mit viel gefühl
im wagen vor mir fährt ein junges mädchen
ich möcht gern wissen was sie grade denkt
hört sie den selben sender oder ist ihr radio aus
fährt sie zum rendezvous oder nach haus
ratta rada radadadada ratta rada radadadada
was will der blöde kerl da hinter mir nur
ich frag mich warum überholt der nicht
der hängt nun schon ne halbe stunde ständig hinter mir
nun dämmerts schon und der fährt ohne licht
der könnt schon hundert kilometer weg sein
mensch fahr an meiner ente doch vorbei
will der mich kontrollieren oder will er mich entführen
oder ist das in zivil die polizei
ratta rada radadadada ratta rada radadadada
wie schön dass ich heut endlich einmal zeit hab
ich muss nicht rasen wie ein wilder stier
ich träum so in gedanken ganz allein und ohne schranken
und wünscht das schöne mädchen wär bei mir
nun wird mir diese sache langsam mulmig
ich fahr die allernächste abfahrt raus
dort werd ich mich verstecken hinter irgendwelchen hecken
verdammt dadurch komm ich zu sät nach haus
bye bye mein schönes mädchen gute reise
sie hat den blinker an hier fährt sie ab
für mich wird in zwei stunden auch die fahrt zuende gehn
doch dich mein mädchen werd ich nie mehr sehn

in the darkness we were waiting
without hope without light
till from heaven you came running
there was mercy in your eyes
to fulfil the law and prophets
to a virgin came the word
from a throne of endless glory
to a cradle in the dirt
praise the father
praise the son
praise the spirit
three in one
god of glory
majesty
praise forever to the king of kings
to reveal the kingdom coming
and to reconcile the lost
to redeem the whole creation
you did not despise the cross
for even in your suffering
you saw to the other side
knowing this was our salvation
jesus for our sake you died
praise the father
praise the son
praise the spirit
three in one
god of glory
majesty
praise forever to the king of kings
and the morning that you rose
all of heaven held its breath
till that stone was moved for good
for the lamb had conquered death
and the dead rose from their tombs
and the angels stood in awe
for the souls of all who'd come
to the father are restored
and the church of christ was born
then the spirit lit the flame
now this gospel truth of old
shall not kneel shall not faint
by his blood and in his name
in his freedom i am free
for the love of jesus christ
who has resurrected me
praise the father
praise the son
praise the spirit
three in one
god of glory
majesty
praise forever to the king of kings
praise the father
praise the son
praise the spirit
three in one
god of glory
majesty
praise forever to the king of kings
o holy night the stars are brightly shining
it is the night of our dear saviour’s birth
long lay the world in sin and error pining
till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
a thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
fall on your knees
o hear the angels voices
o night divine
o night when christ was born
truly he taught us to love one another
his law is love and his gospel is peace
chains he shall break for the slave is our brother
and in his name all oppression shall cease
sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
let all within us praise his holy name
christ is the lord
o praise his name forever
his power and glory evermore
evermore proclaim
his power and glory evermore
evermore proclaim
fall on your knees
o hear the angels voices
o night divine
o night when christ was born
night divine
night o night divine

she sits alone by a lampost
trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
she says "dad's the one i love the most"
but stipe's not far behind
she never lets me in only tells me where she's been
when she's had to much to drink
i say that i don't care i just run my hands through her dark hair
then i pray to god "you gotta help me fly away" and just
let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
let her sing if it eases all her pain
let her go let her walk right out on me
and if the sun comes up tomorrow
let her be let her be
this morning i woke up alone found a note standing by the phone
saying "maybe maybe i'll be back someday"
i wanted to look for you
you walked in i didn't know just what i should do
so i sat back down had a beer and felt sorry for myself
let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
let her sing if it eases all her pain
let her go let her walk right out on me
and if the sun comes up tomorrow
let her be oh
last night i tried to leave
cried so much i could not believe
she was the same girl i fell in love with long ago
she went in the back to get high
i sat down on my couch and cried yelling
"oh mama please help me won't you hold my hand"
let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
let her sing if it eases all her pain
let her go let her walk right out on me
and if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be
let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
let her sing if it eases all her pain
let her go let her walk right out on me
and if the sun comes up tomorrow
let her be oh let her be
you and me we come from diff'rent worlds
you like to laugh at me when i look at other girls
sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
i'm such a baby 'cause the dolphins make me cry
well there's nothing i can do
i've been looking for a girl like you
you look at me you got nothing left to say
i'll only pout at you until i get my way
i won't dance you won't sing
i just want to love you but you want to wear my ring
well there's nothing i can do
i only wanna be with you
you can call me your fool
only wanna be with you
put on a little dylan sitting on a fence
i say "that line is great" you ask me what i meant by
"said i shot a man named gray took his wife to italy
she inherits a million bucks and when she died it came to me
i can't help it if i'm lucky
i only wanna be with you
ain't bobby so cool
yeah i'm tangled up in blue
i only wanna be with you
you can call me your fool
i only wanna be with you
sometimes i wonder if will ever end
you get so mad at me when i go out with my friends
sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
i'm such a baby yeah the dolphins make me cry
well there's nothing i can do
i only wanna be with you
you can call me your fool
i only wanna be with you
yeah i'm tangled up in blue
i only wanna be with you also
sometimes i feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
and i can't help but ask myself how much i'll let the fear take the wheel and steer
driven me before and it seems to have a vague haunting mass appeal
but lately i am begining to find that i should be the one behind the wheel
whatever tomorrow brings i'll be there with open arms and open eyes
whatever tomorrow brings i'll be there
so if i decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive
will i choose water over wine and hold my own and drive oh oh
it's driven me before it seems to be the way
that everyone else get around
lately i'm beginning to find that when i drive myself my light is found
whatever tomorrow brings i'll be there with open arms and open eyes
whatever tomorrow brings i'll be there
would you choose water over wine hold the wheel and drive
whatever tomorrow brings i'll be there with open arms and open eyes
whatever tomorrow brings i'll be there

i am a man who walks alone
and when i'm walking a dark road
at night or strolling through the park
when the lights begin to change
i sometimes feel a little strange
a little anxious when it's dark
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
have you run your fingers down the wall
and have you felt your neck skin crawl
when you're searching for the light
sometimes when you're scared to take a look
at the corner of the room
you've sensed that something's watching you
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
have you ever been alone at night
thought you heard footsteps behind
and turned around and no one's there
and as you quicken up your pace
you find it hard to look again
because you're sure there's someone there
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
watching horror films the night before
debating witches and folklore
the unknown troubles on your mind
maybe your mind is playing tricks
you sense and suddenly eyes fix
on dancing shadows from behind
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
when i'm walking a dark road
i am the man who walks alone

ooh he ey oh
what we're living in let me tell ya
it's a wonder man can eat at all
when things are big that should be small
who can tell what magic spells
will be doing for us
and i'm giving all my love to this world
only to be told
i can't see i can't breathe
no more will we be
and nothing's going to change the way we live
cos' we can always take but never give
an' now that things're changing for the worse see
woah
it's a crazy world we're living in
and i just can't see that
half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these
futures made of virtu al insani ty now
always seem to be governed by this love we have for
useless twisting of the new techno logy
oh now there is no sound for we all live underground
and i'm thinking what a mess we're in
hard to know where to begin
if i could slip the sickly ties
that earthly man has made
and now every mother can choose the colour
of her child that's not nature's way
well that's what they said yesterday
there's nothing left to do but pray
i think it's time i found a new religion wo ah
it's so insane to synthesize another strain
there's something in these futures that we have to be told
futures made of virtu al insani ty now
always seem to be governed by this love we have for
useless twisting of the new techno logy
oh now there is no sound for we all live underground
now there is no sound if we all live underground
and now it's virtual insanity
forget your virtual real ity
oh there's nothing so bad i know ye ah
futures made of virtu al insani ty now
always seem to be governed by this love we have for
useless twisting of the new techno logy
oh now there is no sound for we all live underground
living virtu al insani – ty
living virtu al insani – ty
living virtu al insani – ty
living virtu al insani – ty

there's the moon asking to stay
long enough for the clouds to fly me away
oooh it's my time coming i'm not afraid afraid to die
my fading voice sings of looooooooooove
but she cries to the clicking of time of time
wait in the fire
wait in the fire
wait in the fire
wait in the fire
the fire
and she weeps on my arm
walking to the bright lights in sorrow
oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow oh my love
and the rain is faaalling and i believe my time has come
it reminds me of the pain i might leave leave behind
wait in the fire
wait in the fire
wait in the fire
wait in the fire
the fire
it reminds me of the pain i might leave leave behind
and i feel them drown my name
so easy to know and forget with this kiss
but i'm not afraid to go but it goes so slooooooooooooooow
oooooooooooooooooh
wait in the fire
wait in the fire oooooh oooooh oooooh
wait in the fire
wait in the fire
wait in the fire

i heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music do you
well it goes like this
the fourth the fifth the minor fall and the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
well your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to her kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew a hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelu jah
baby i've been here before
i've seen this room and i've walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
and i've seen your flag on the marble arch
and love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
there was a time when you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show that to me do you
but remember when i moved in you
and the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
maybe there's a god above
but all i've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleluuuu
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleluuuuujah
i lost myself on a cool damp night
gave myself in that misty light
was hypnotized by a strange delight
under a lilac tree
i made wine from the lilac tree
put my heart in its recipe
it makes me see what i want to see
and be what i want to be
when i think more than i want to think
do things i never should do
i drink much more than i ought to drink
because it brings me back you
lilac wine is sweet and heady like my love
lilac wine i feel unsteady like my love
listen to me i cannot see clearly
isn't that she coming to me nearly here
lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love
lilac wine i feel unsteady where's my love
listen to me why is everything so hazy
isnt that she or am i just going crazy dear
lilac wine i feel unready for my love
i feel unready for my love
looking out the door i see the rain fall upon the
funeral mourners
parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes
fill up with water
and maybe i'm too young
to keep good love from going wrong
but tonight you're on my mind so
you'll never know
i'm broken down and hungry for your love with no
way to feed it
where are you tonight
child you know how much i need it
too young to hold on
and too old to just break free and run
sometimes a man gets carried away
when he feels like he should be having his fun
and much too blind to see the damage he's done
sometimes a man must awake to find that really
he has noone
so i'll wait for you and i'll burn
oh will i ever see your sweet return
oh will i ever learn
oh oh oh lover
you should've come over
'cause it's not too late
lonely is the room the bed is made
buurning in the corner is the only one
my body turns and yearns for a sleep
that won't ever come
it's never over my kingdom for a kiss
it's never over all my riches for her smiles
it's never over
it's never over she's the tear
maybe i'm just too young
to keep good love from going wrong
oh oh ohh oh
oh oh oh
lover you should've come over yeah yeah yes i
feel too young to hold on
i'm much too hold to break free and run
too deaf dumb and blind to see the damage i've done
sweeeeet looover you should've come over
oh i would've waited for you
ad lib lover lover lover lover love love lover love love
loooooooooooooooooooooooo lover you should've come over
cause it's not too late

whoooo who will save your souls after all those lies that you told boy
and who will save your souls if you won't save your own
ladida

there are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
so we bargain with the devil but you're ok for today say

it's been swell sweetheart but it was just one of those things
those flings those strings you've got to cut
so get out on the streets girls and bust your butts

and who will save save yooooooooooooour soul if you won't save your own

ever since the days of old
men would search for wealth untold
they'd dig for silver and for gold
and leave the empty holes
and way down south in the everglades
where the black water rolls and the saw grass waves
the eagles fly and the otters play

progress came and took its toll
and in the name of flood control
they made their plans and they drained the land

of osceola cry
so blow blow seminole wind
blow like you're never gonna blow again

but i know who you are
and blow blow from the okeechobee
all the way up to micanopy

"welcome to the real world"
she said to me condescendingly
"take a seat take your life
plot it out in black and white"
well i never lived the dreams of the prom kings and the drama queens
i'd like to think the best of me
is still hiding up my sleeve
they love to tell you stay inside the lines
but something's better on the other side
i want to run through the halls of my high school
i want to scream at the top of my lungs
i just found out there's no such thing as the real world
just a lie you've got to rise above
so the good boys and girls
take the socalled right track
faded white hats grabbing credits maybe transfers
they read all the books but they can't find the answers
all of our parents they're getting older
i wonder if they've wished for anything better
while in their memories tiny tragedies
they love to tell you stay inside the lines
but something's better on the other side
i want to run through the halls of my high school
i want to scream at the top of my lungs
i just found out there's no such thing as the real world
just a lie you've got to rise above
i am invincible
i am invincible
i am invincible
as long as i'm alive
i want to run through the halls of my high school
i want to scream at the top of my lungs
i just found out there's no such thing as the real world
just a lie you've got to rise above
i just can't wait for my ten year reunion
i'm gonna bust down the double doors
and when i stand on these tables before you
you will know what all this time was for

swears like a sailor when shaves her legs
she takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'
i'm never gonna let her go
he's got more balls than a big brass monkey

against all odds

what child is this who laid to rest
on mary's lap is sleeping
whom angels greet with anthems sweet
while shepherds watch are keeping
this this is christ the king
whom shepherds guard and angels sing
haste haste to bring him laud
the babe the son of mary
why lies he in such mean estate
where ox and ass are feeding
good christians fear for sinners here
the silent word is pleading

the cross be borne for me for you
hail hail the word made flesh
the babe the son of mary
so bring him incense gold and myrrh
come peasant king to own him

let loving hearts enthrone him

someday we'll find it the rainbow connection
the lovers the dreamers and me
have you been half asleep and have you heard voices
i've heard them calling my name
are these the sweet sounds that called the young sailors
i think they're one and the same
i've heard it too many times to ignore it

someday we'll find it the rainbow connection
the lovers the dreamers and me
someday we'll find it the rainbow connection
the lovers the dreamers and me

ya no estás más a mi lado corazón
en el alma sólo tengo soledad
y si ya no puedo verte
porque dios lo hizo quererte
para hacerme sufrir más
siempre fuiste la razón de mi existir
adorarte para mí fue religión
en tus besos yo encontraba
el calor que me brindaba
el amor de tu pasión
es la historia de un amor
como no hay otro igual
que me hizo comprender
que le dio luz a mi vida
apagándola después
ayque noche tan obscura
sin tu amor no viviré
siempre fuiste la razón de mi existir
adorarte para mí fue religión
en tus besos yo encontraba
el calor que me brindaba
el amor de tu pasión
es la historia de un amor
como no hay otro igual
que me hizo comprender
que le dio luz a mi vida
apagándola después
ayque noche tan obscura
sin tu amor no viviré

many nights we've prayed with no proof anyone could hear
in our hearts a hopeful song we barely understood
now we are not afraid although we know there's much to fear
we were moving mountains long before we knew we could
there can be miracles when you believe
though hope is frail it's hard to kill
who knows what miracles you can achieve
when you believe
somehow you will you will when you believe
in this time of fear when prayer so often proves in vain
hope seemed like the summer birds too swiftly flown away
yet now i'm standing here my heart's so full i can't explain
seeking faith and speaking words i never thought i'd say
there can be miracles when you believe
though hope is frail it's hard to kill
who knows what miracles you can achieve
when you believe
somehow you will you will when you believe
they don’t always happen when you ask
and it’s easy to give in to your fear
but when you’re blinded by your pain
can’t see your way safe through the rain
thought of a still resilient voice
says love is very near
there can be miracles when you believe
though hope is frail it's hard to kill
who knows what miracles you can achieve
when you believe
somehow you will now you will
you will when you believe
you will when you believe
no i can't forget this evening
or your face as you were leaving
but i guess that's just the way the story goes
you always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
yes it shows
no i can't forget tomorrow
when i think of all my sorrow
when i had you there but then i let you go
and now it's only fair that i should let you know
what you should know
i can't live
if living is without you
i can't live
i can't give anymore
i can't live
if living is without you
i can't give
i can't give anymore
well i can't forget this evening
or your face as you were leaving
but i guess that's just the way the story goes
you always smile but in your eyes your sorrow show
yes it shows
i can't live
if living is without you
i can't live
i can't give anymore
i can't live
if living is without you
i can't give
i can't give anymore
i can't live
if living is without you
i can't live
i can't give anymore
i can't live
if living is without you
i can't give
i can't give anymore

when the music fades all is stripped away and i simply come
longing just to bring something that's of worth that will bless
your heart
i'll bring you more than a song for a song in itself is not what you have
required you search much deeper within through the way things appear
you're looking into my heart
i'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you it's all
about you jesus
i'm sorry lord for the thing i made it when it's all about you it's all
about you jesus
king of endless worth no one could express how much you deserve
though i'm weak and poor all i have is yours every single breath
i'll bring you more than a song for a song in itself is not what you have
required you search much deeper within through the way things appear
you're looking into my heart
i'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you it's all
about you jesus
i'm sorry lord for the thing i made it when it's all about you it's all
about you jesus
i'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you it's all
about you jesus
i'm sorry lord for the thing i made it when it's all about you it's all
about you jesus
i want to hold the hand inside you
i want to take a breath that's true
i look to you and i see nothing
i look to you to see the truth
you live your life you go in shadows
you'll come apart and you'll go black
some kind of night into your darkness
colors your eyes with what's not there
fade into you
strange you never knew
fade into you
i think it's strange you never knew
a stranger's light comes on slowly
a stranger's heart without a home
you put your hands into your head
and then smiles cover your heart
fade into you
strange you never knew
fade into you
i think it's strange you never knew
fade into you
strange you never knew
fade into you
i think it's strange you never knew
i think it's strange you never knew

till the sandman he comes
sleep with one eye open

something's wrong shut the light
heavy thoughts tonight
and they aren't of snow white
dreams of war dreams of liars
dreams of dragon's fire
and of things that will bite
sleep with one eye open
ex it light
ent er night
take my hand
we're off to nevernever land
hush little baby don't say a word
in your closet in your head
ex it light
ent er night
grain of sand
ex it light
ent er night
take my hand
we're off to nevernever land

mama she has taught me well
told me when i was young
son your life's an open book
don't close it 'fore it's done
the brightest flame burns quickest
is what i heard her say
a son's heart sewed to mother
but i must find my way
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama let my heart go
or let this heart be still
rebel my new last name
wild blood in my veins
apron strings around my neck
the mark that still remains
left home at an early age
of what i heard was wrong
i never asked forgiveness
but what is said is done
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama let my heart go
or let this heart be still
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
so let this heart be still
mama now i'm coming home
i'm not all you wished of me
a mother's love for her son
spoken help me be
well i took your love for granted
and all the things you said to me
i need your arms to welcome me
but a cold stone's all i see
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama let my heart go
or let this heart be still
let my heart go
mama let my heart go
you never let my heart go
so let this heart be still
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
so let this heart be still
so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
and nothing else matters
never opened myself this way
life is ours we live it our way
all these words i don't just say
and nothing else matters
trust i seek and i find in you
every day for us something new
open mind for a different view
and nothing else matters
never cared for what they do
never cared for what they know
but i know
so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
and nothing else matters
never cared for what they do
never cared for what they know
but i know
never opened myself this way
life is ours we live it our way
all these words i don't just say
and nothing else matters
trust i seek and i find in you
every day for us something new
open mind for a different view
and nothing else matterers
never cared for what they say
never cared for games they play
never cared for what they do
never cared for what they know
and i know
so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
no nothing else matters
lay beside me tell me what they've done
speak the words i want to hear to make my demons run
the door is locked now but it's opened if you're true
if you can understand the me then i can understand the you
lay beside me under wicked skies
through black of day dark of night we share this paralyze
the door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
black heart scarring darker still but there's no sun shining through
no there's no sun shining through
no there's no sun shining
what i've felt what i've known
turn the pages turn the stone
behind the door should i open it for you
what i've felt what i've known
sick and tired i stand alone
could you be there 'cause i'm the one who waits for you
come beside me this won't hurt i swear
she loves me not she loves me still but she'll never love again
she lay beside me but she'll be there when i'm gone
black heart scarring darker still yes she'll be there when i'm gone
yes she'll be there when i'm gone
dead sure she'll be there
what i've felt what i've known
turn the pages turn to stone
behind the door should i open it for you
what i've felt what i've known
sick and tired i stand alone
could you be there 'cause i'm the one who waits for you
lay beside me tell me what i've done
the door is closed so are your eyes
but now i see the sun now i see the sun

what i've felt what i've known

what i've felt what i've known
turn the pages turn the stone
behind the door should i open it for you
what i've felt what i've known
i take this key
and i bury it in you
because you're unforgiven too
never free
'cause you're unforgiven too
new blood joins this earth and quickly he's subdued
through constant pain disgrace the young boy learns their rules
with time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
deprived of all his thoughts the young man struggles on and on
he knows oo a vow unto his own that never from this day
his will they'll take a way
what i've felt what i've known never shined through in what i've shown
never be never see won't see what might have been
what i've felt what i've knownnever shined through in what i've shown
never free never me so i dub the unforgiven
they dedicate their lives to running all of his
he tries to please them all this bitter man he is
throughout the life the same he's battled constantly
this fight he cannot win a tired man they see no longer cares
the old man then prepares to die regretfully
that old man here is me
what i've felt what i've known never shined through in what i've shown
never be never see won't see what might have been
what i've felt what i've knownnever shined through in what i've shown
never free never me so i dub the unforgiven

on a long and lonesome highway east of omaha
you can listen to the engine moanin' out his one long song
you can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
but your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
when you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' much to do
and you don't feel much like ridin' you just wish the trip was through
here i am on the road again
there i am up on the stage
here i go playin' the star again
there i go turn the page
so you walk into this restaurant all strung out from the road
and you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold
you pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode
yeah most times you can't hear 'em talk other times you can
all the same old cliches is it woman is it man
and you always seem outnumbered you don't dare make a stand
here i am on the road again
there i am up on the stage
here i go playin' the star again
there i go turn the page
out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away
every ounce of energy you try and give away
as the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play
later in the evening as you lie awake in bed
with the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
you smoke the day's last cigarette rememberin' what she said
here i am on the road again
there i am up on the stage
and here i go playin' the star again
there i go turn the page
there i go turn that page
there i gooo yeah yeah

brighter than tomorrow

wound this earth crucify this soul

another day has gone i'm still all alone
how could this be you're not here with me
you never said goodbye someone tell me why
did you have to go and leave my world so cold
everyday i sit and ask myself how did love slip away
something whispers in my ear and says that
you are not alone for i am here with you
though you're far away i am here to stay
but you are not alone for i am here with you
though we're far apart you're always in my heart
but you are not alone

just the other night i thought i heard you cry
asking me to come and hold you in my arms
i can hear your prayers your burdens i will bear
but first i need your hand then forever can begin
everyday i sit and ask myself how did love slip away
something whispers in my ear and says that
you are not alone for i am here with you

but you are not alone for i am here with you
though we're far apart you're always in my heart

love is one big illusion i should try to forget
but there is something left in my head
you're the one who set it up now you're the one to make it stop
i'm the one who's feeling lost right now
now you want me to forget every little thing you said
but there is something left in my head
i won't forget the way you're kissing
the feelings so strong were lasting for so long
but i'm not the man your heart is missing
that's why you go away i know
you were never satisfied no matter how i tried
now you wanna say goodbye to me
love is one big illusion i should try to forget
but there is something left in my head
i won't forget the way you're kissing
the feelings so strong were lasting for so long
but i'm not the man your heart is missing
that's why you go away i know
sitting here all alone in the middle of nowhere
don't know which way to go
there ain't so much to say now between us
there ain't so much for you
there ain't so much for me anymore
i won't forget the way you're kissing
the feelings so strong were lasting for so long
but i'm not the man your heart is missing
that's why you go away i know

looking back over my shoulder
i can see that look in your eyes
i never dreamed it could be over
i never wanted to say good bye
looking back over my shoulder
with an aching deep in my heart
i wish we were starting over
oh instead we're drifting so far apart
everybody told me you were leaving
funny i should be the last to know
baby please tell me that i'm dreaming
i just never want to let you go
looking back over my shoulder
i can see that look in your eyes
turning my heart over and over
i never wanted to say good bye
i don't mind everybody laughing
but it's enough to make a grown man cry
'cause i can feel you're slipping through my fingers
i don't even know the reason why
everyday it's a losing battle
just to smile and hold my head up high
could it be we belong together
baby won't you give me one more try
one more try
looking back over my shoulder
i can see that look in your eyes
i never dreamed it could be over
i never wanted to say good bye
there's ways to murder anyone
one and two are the same
and they both work as well
i'm coming clean for amy
julie doesn't scream as well
and the cops won't listen all night
and so maybemaybe i'll be over
just as soon as i fill them all in
and i can remember when i saw her last
we were running all around and having a blast
but the backseat of the drivein is so lonely without
i know when you're home
i was thinking about you
there was something i forgot to say
i was crying on a saturday night
i was out cruising without you
they were playing our song
crying on a saturday night
as the moon becomes the night time
you go viciously quietly away
i'm sitting in the bedroom where we used to sit and
now i'm watching
watching you die
and i can remember when i saw her last
we were running all around and having a blast
but the backseat of the drivein is so lonely without you
i know when you're home
i was thinking about you
there was something i forgot to say
i was crying on a saturday night
i was out cruising without you
they were playing our song
crying on a saturday night
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah eaa
crying on a saturday night
crying on a saturday night

close my eyes
feel me now
i don't know maybe you could not love me now
you will know and her feet down to the ground
over there and i want true love to love
you can't hide oh no from the way i feel
turn my head
into sound
i don't know when i lay down on the ground
you will find the way it hurts to love
never cared and the world turned hearts to love
you will see oh now oh the way i do
you will wait
see me go
i don't care when your head turned all alone
you will wait when i turn my eyes around
overhead when i hold you next to me
overhead to know oh the way i see
close my eyes
feel me how
i don't know maybe you could not hurt me now
here alone when i feel down too
over there when i await true love for you
you can hide oh no oh the way i do
you will see oh now oh the way i do

when i look at you
oh i don't know what's real
once in a while
and you make me laugh
and i'll see you tomorrow
and it won't be long
once in a while
then you take me down
then you walk away
when you say 'i do'
oh i don't believe you
i can't forget it
no
when you sleep tomorrow
and it won't be long
once in a while
when you make me smile
when you turn your long blond hair
when i look at you
oh i don't know what's real
once in a while
and you make me laugh
and i'll sleep tomorrow
and it won't be long
once in a while
then you take me down
when you walk away
i thought i saw a man brought to life
he was warm he came around like he was dignified
he showed me what it was to cry
well you couldn't be that man i adored
you don't seem to know
don't seem to care what your heart is for
but i don't know him anymore
there's nothing where he used to lie
my conversation has run dry
that's what's going on
nothing's fine
i'm torn
i'm all out of faith this is how i feel
i'm cold and i am shamed lying naked on the floor
illusion never changed into something real
i'm wide awake and i can see the perfect sky is torn
you're a little late i'm already torn
so i guess the fortune teller's right
i should have seen just what was there and not some holy light
but you crawl beneath my veins and now
i don't care i have no luck
i don't miss it all that much
there's just so many things
that i can't touch
i'm torn
i'm all out of faith this is how i feel
i'm cold and i am shamed lying naked on the floor
illusion never changed into something real
i'm wide awake and i can see the perfect sky is torn
you're a little late i'm already torn
torn ooooh hoo ooooh ooooh
there's nothing where he used to lie
my inspiration has run dry
that's what's going on
nothing's right
i'm torn
i'm all out of faith this is how i feel
i'm cold and i am shamed lying naked on the floor
illusion never changed into something real
i'm wide awake and i can see the perfect sky is torn
i'm all out of faith this is how i feel
i'm cold and i am shamed bound and broken on the floor
you're a little late i'm already torn
torn
ooh

she used to work in a diner never saw a woman look finer
i used to order just to watch her float across the floor
she grew up in a small town never put her roots down
somewhere on a desert highway she rides a harley davidson
her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind she's been runnin' half her life
the chrome and steel she rides collidin' with the very air she breathes
the air she breathes
you know it ain't easy you got to hold on
she was an unknown legend in her time
now she's dressin' two kids lookin' for a magic kiss
somewhere on a desert highway she rides a harley davidson
her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind she's been runnin' half her life
the chrome and steel she rides collidin' with the very air she breathes
the air she breathes

two onetwothreefour
the only girl i've ever loved
was born with roses in her eyes
but then they buried her alive
one evening nineteenfortyfive
with just her sister at her side
and only weeks before the guns
all came and rained on everyone
now she's a little boy in spain
playing pianos filled with flames
on empty rings around the sun
all sing to say my dream has come
but now we must pick up every piece
of the life we used to love
just to keep ourselves
at least enough to carry on
and now we ride the circus wheel
with your dark brother wrapped in white
says it was good to be alive
but now he rides a comet's flame
and won't be coming back again
the earth looks better from a star
that's right above from where you are
he didn't mean to make you cry
with sparks that ring and bullets fly
on empty rings around your heart
the world just screams and falls apart
but now we must pick up every piece
of the life we used to love
just to keep ourselves
at least enough to carry on
and here's where your mother sleeps
and here is the room where your brothers were born
indentions in the sheets
where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
and it's so sad to see the world agree
that they'd rather see their faces filled with flies
all when i'd want to keep white roses in their eyes
what a beautiful face
i have found in this place
that is circling all around the sun
what a beautiful dream
that could flash on the screen
in a blink of an eye and be gone from me
soft and sweet
let me hold it close and keep it here with me
and one day we will die
and our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
but for now we are young
let us lay in the sun
and count every beautiful thing we can see
love to be
in the arms of all i'm keepin here with me
what a curious life we have found here tonight
there is music that sounds from the street
there are lights in the cloud
anna's ghost all around
hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
soft and sweet
how the notes all bend and reach above the trees
now how i remember you
how i would push my fingers through
your mouth to make those muscles move
that make your voice so smooth and sweet
and now we keep where we don't know
all secrets sleep in winter clothes
with one you loved so long ago
what a beautiful face
i have found in this place
that is circling all around the sun
and when we meet on a cloud
i'll be laughing out loud
i'll be laughing with everyone i see
can't believe
how strange it is to be anything at all
oh comely
i will be with you when you lose your breath
chasing the only meaningful memory you thought you had left
with some pretty bright and bubbly terrible scene
that was doing her thing on your chest
but oh comely
it isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
it doesn't mean anything at all
oh comely
all of your friends are letting you blow
bristling and ugly
bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
of some pretty bright and bubbly friend
you could need to say comforting things in your ear
but oh comely
there isn't such one friend that you could find here
i'll crush him with everything i own
say what you want to say
and hang for your hollow ways moving your mouth
to pull out all your miracles aimed for me
your father made fetuses
while you and your mother
were asleep in the trailer park
thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
the music and medicine you needed for comforting
so make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
and pluck all your silly strings
and bend all your notes for me
soft silly music is meaningful magical
the movements were beautiful
all in your ovaries
all of them milking with green fleshy flowers
while powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
smelling of semen all under the garden
was all you were needing when you still believed in me
say what you wanna say and hang for your hollow ways
moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed for me

i know they buried her body with others
her sister and mother and families
and will she remember me years later
i wished i could save her in some sort of time machine
know all your enemies
we know who our enemies are
know all your enemies
we know who our enemies are

two headed boy
all floating in glass
the sun it has passed
now it's blacker than black
i can hear as you tap on your jar
i am listening to hear where you are
i am listening to hear where you are
two headed boy
put on sunday shoes
and dance round the room to accordion keys
with the needle that sings in your heart
catching signals that sound in the dark
catching signals that sound in the dark
we will take off our clothes
and they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
and when all is breaking everything that you could keep inside
now your eyes ain't moving now they just lay there in their climb
two headed boy
with pulleys and weights
creating a radio played just for two
in the parlor with a moon across her face
and through the music he sweetly displays
silver speakers that sparkle all day
made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
and in the dark we will take off our clothes
and they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
and when all is breaking everything that you could keep inside
now your eyes ain't moving now they just lay there in their cliiiiimb
two headed boy
ther's no reason to grieve
the world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
left beneath christmas trees in the snow
and i will take you and leave you alone
watching spirals of white softly flow
over your eyelids and all you did
will wait until the point when you let go
dee dee dee dee dee dee du dee dee
dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee

i don't believe in an interventionist god
but i know darlin' that you do
but if i did i would kneel down and ask him
not to intervene when it came to you
well not to touch a hair on your head
leave you as you are
and if he felt he had to direct you
then direct you into my arms
into my arms o lord into my arms o lord
into my arms o lord into my arms
and i don't believe in the existence of angels
but looking at you i wonder is that true
but if i did i would summon them together
and ask them to watch over you
to each burn a candle for you
to make bright and clear your path
and to walk like christ in grace and love
and guide you into my arms
into my arms o lord into my arms o lord
into my arms o lord into my arms
but i believe in love
and i know that you do too
and i believe in some kind of path
that we can walk down me and you
so keep your candles burning
and make a journey bright and pure
that you will keep returning
always and evermore
into my arms o lord into my arms o lord
into my arms o lord into my arms
bars
take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires
hey man you know you're never coming back
on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with a red right hand
he'll wrap you in his arms tell you that you've been a good boy
he'll reach deep into the hole heal your shrinking soul
but there won't be a single thing that you can do
they're whispering his name through this disappearing land
but hidden in his coat is a red right hand
you don't have no money he'll get you some
you don't have no self respect you feel like an insect
well don't you worry buddy 'cause here he comes
a shadow is cast wherever he stands
stacks of green paper in his red right hand


e|||||

e|||||
e|||||
you'll see him in your nightmares you'll see him in your dreams
you'll see him in your head on the tv screen
hey buddy i'm warning you to turn it off
you're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
designed and directed by his red right hand
they call me the wild rose but my name was eliza day
why they call me that i do not know for my name was eliza day
from the first day i saw her i knew she was the one
she stared in my eyes and smiled
her lips were the colour of the roses
that grew down the river all bloody and wild
when he knocked on my door and entered the room
my trembling subsided in his sure embrace
he would be my first man and with a careful hand
he wiped up the tears that ran down my face
they call me the wild rose but my name was eliza day
why they call me that i do not know for my name was eliza day
on the second day i brought her a flower
she was more beautiful than any woman i'd seen
i said do you know where the wild roses grow
so sweet and scarlet and free
on the second day he came with a single red rose
he said give me your loss and your sorrow
i nodded my head as i lay on the bed
if i show you the roses will you follow
they call me the wild rose but my name was eliza day
why they call me that i do not know for my name was eliza day
on the third day he took me to the river
he showed me the roses and we kissed
and the last thing i heard was a muttered word
as he knelt above me with a rock in his fist
on the last day i took her where the wild roses grow
as she lay on the bank the wind light as a thief
and i kissed her goodbye said all beauty must die
and i leant down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth
they call me the wild rose but my name was eliza day
why they call me that i do not know for my name was eliza day
my name was eliza day for my name was eliza day
i hurt myself today to see if i still feel
i focus on the pain the only thing thats real
the needle tears a hole the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away but i remember everything
what have i become my sweetest friend
everyone i know goes away in the end
and you could have it all my empire of dirt
i will let you down i will make you hurt
i wear this crown of shit upon my liars chair
full of broken thoughts i cannot repair
beneath the stains of time the feeling disappears
you are someone else i am still right here
what have i become my sweetest friend
everyone i know goes away in the end
and you could have it all my empire of dirt
i will let you down i will make you hurt
if i could start again a million miles away
i would keep myself i would find a way

come as you are as you were as i want you to be
as a friend as a friend as an old enemy
take your time hurry up the choice is yours don't be late
take a rest as a friend as an old memoria
memoria memoria memoria
come dowsed in mud soaked in bleach as i want you to be
as a trend as a friend as an old memoria
memoria memoria memoria
and i swear that i don't have a gun
no i don't have a gun no i don't have a gun
memoria memoria memoria
and i swear that i don't have a gun
no i don't have a gun no i don't have a gun
no i don't have a gun no i don't have a gun

where do bad folks go when they die
they dont go to heaven where the angels fly
they go to a lake out of fire and fry
wont see them again till the fourth of july
i knew a lady who came from duluth
she got bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
she went to her grave just a little too soon
and flew away howling on the yellow moon
where do bad folks go when they die
they dont go to heaven where the angels fly
they go to a lake out of fire and fry
wont see them again till the fourth of july
now the people cry and the people moan
they look for a dry place to call their home
and try to find some place to rest their bones
while the angels and the devils try to make them their own
where do bad folks go when they die
they dont go to heaven where the angels fly
they go to a lake out of fire and fry
wont see them again till the fourth of july

truth covered in security
i can't let you smother me
i'd like to but it couldn't work
trading off and taking turns
i don't regret a thing
and i've got this friend you see
who makes me feel
and i wanted more
than i could steal
i'll arrest myself
i'll wear a shield
i'll go out of my way
to prove i still
smell her on you
don't tell me what i wanna hear
afraid of never knowing fear
experience anything you need
i'll keep fighting jealousy
until it's fucking gone
and i've got this friend you see
who makes me feel
and i wanted more
than i could steal
i'll arrest myself
i'll wear a shield
i'll go out of my way
to prove i still
smell her on you

to make you a deal
we've made a pact
to learn form who
ever we want
without new rules
and we'll share what's lost
and what we grew
they'll go out of their way
to prove they still
smell her on you

smell her on you

if i had to lose a mile
if i had to touch feeling
i would lose my soul

sprinkled with emotion
invented at your birth

sprinkled with emotion
invented at your birth

clean
many a hand have scaled the grand old face of the plateau
some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
to beautify the foothills shake the many hands
nothing on top but a bucket and a mop and an illustrated book about birds
see a lot up there but don't be scared who needs action when you got words
finished with the mop then you can stop and look at what you've done
plateau's clean no dirt to be seen and the work it was fun
nothing on top but a bucket and a mop and an illustrated book about birds
see a lot up there but don't be scared who needs action when you got words
many a hand began to scan around for the next plateau
some say it was greenland some say mexico
others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
those were all just guesses wouldn't help you if they could

he said i was his friend
which came as a surprise
i spoke into his eyes

here's a thought for every man who tries to understand
what is in his hands what's in his hands
he walks along the open road of love and life
surviving if he can only if he can
bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
as he faced the sun he cast no shadow
as they took his soul they stole his pride pride
as he faced the sun he cast no shadow

damn my situation and the games i have to play
with all the things caught in my mind

so don't go away
slip inside the eye of your mind
don't you know you might find
a better place to play
you said that you'd never been
but all the things that you've seen
slowly fade away
so i start a revolution from my bed
cos you said the brains i have went to my head
step outside the summertime's in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face
cos you ain't ever going to burn my heart out
so sally can wait she knows it's too late
as we're walking on by
her soul slides away but don't look back in anger
i heard you say
take me to the place where you go
where nobody knows
if it's night or day
please don't put your life in the hands
of a rock and roll band
who'll throw it all away
so i start a revolution from my bed
cos you said the brains i have went to my head
step outside the summertime's in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face
cos you ain't ever going to burn my heart out
so sally can wait she knows it's too late
as we're walking on by
her soul slides away but don't look back in anger
i heard you say
so sally can wait she knows it's too late
as we're walking on by
her soul slides away but don't look back in anger
i heard you say
so sally can wait she knows it's too late
as we're walking on by
her soul slides away
but don't look back in anger
dont look back in anger
i heard you say
at least not today
i would like to leave this city this old town don't smell too pretty
and i can feel the warning signs running around my mind
and when i leave this island i'll book myself into a soul asylum
cos' i can feel the warning signs running around my mind
so here i go still scratching around in the same old hole
my body feels young but my mind is very oold
so what do you say you can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
half the world away half the world away half the world away
i've been lost i've been found but i dont feel down
and when i leave this planet you know i'd stay but i just can't stand it and
i can feel the warning signs running around my mind
and if i could leave this spirit i'll find me a hole and i'll live in it
and i can feel the warning signs running around my mind
so here i go still scratching around in the same old hole
my body feels young but my mind is very oold
so what do you say you can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
half the world away half the world away half the world away
i've been lost i've been found but i dont feel down
no i don't feel down

i don't feel as if i know you
you take up all my time
the days are long and the night will throw you away
cos the sun don't shine
nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
we live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
and it's never gonna be the same
cos the years are falling by like the rain
it's never gonna be the same
till the life i knew comes to my house and says
hello
nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day

slide away and give it all you've got
my today fell in from the top
i dream of you and all the things you say
i wonder where you are now
hold me down all the world's asleep
i need you now you've knocked me off my feet
i dream of you we talk of growing old
but you said please don't
slide in baby together we'll fly
i've tried praying and i know just what you're saying to me
now that you're mine
we'll find a way
of chasing the sun
let me be the one
who shines with you
in the morning when you don't know what to do
two of a kind
we'll find a way
to do what we've done
let me be the one that shines with you
and we can slide away slide away
awayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
some might say that sunshine follows thunder
go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
some might say that we should never ponder
on our thoughts today coz they hold sway over time
some might say we will find a brighter day
some might say we will find a brighter day
coz i've been standing at the station
in need of education in the rain
you made no preparation for my reputation once again
the sink is full of fishes she got dirty dishes on the brain
it was overflowing gently but its all elementary my friend
music for rest of song verse chorus and bridge as above
some might say
some might say
you know what some might say
you know what some might say
you know what some might say
you know what some might say
you know what some might say
you know what some might say
you know what some might say
you know what some might say
fade out
i need to be myself
i can't be no one else
i'm feeling supersonic give me gin and tonic
you can have it all but how much do you want it
you make me laugh
give me your autograph

langya talaga wala ka bang ibang alam
namumugtong mga mata
kailan pa ba kaya ikaw magsasawa
sa problema na iyong pinapasan
hatid sayo ng boyfriend mong hindi mo maintindihan
may kwento kang pandrama na naman
ang pagtiyaga mo dyan sa boyfriend mong tanga
na wala nang ginagawa kundi ang paluhain ka
sa libulibong pagkakataon na tayoy nagkasama
iilang ulit palang kitang nakitang masaya
naiinis akong isipin na ginaganyan ka ya
siguro ay hindi niya lang alam ang iyong
tunay na halaga
hindi na dapat pagusapan pa
nagpapagod na rin ako sa aking kakasalita
hindi ka rin naman nakikinig
kahit sobrang pagod na ang aking bibig
sa mga payo kong di mo pinapansin
akala mo'y nakikinig di rin naman tatanggapin
ayoko nang isipin pa
di ko alam ba't di mo makayanan na iwanan sya
ang damidami naman diyang iba
wag kang mangangambang baka wala ka nang ibang makita
na lalake na magmahal sayo
at hinding hindi nya sasayangin ang pagibig mo
sa libulibong pagkakataon na tayoy nagkasama
iilang ulit palang kitang nakitang masaya
naiinis akong isipin na ginaganyan ka ya
siguro ay hindi niya lang alam ang iyong
tunay na halaga
sa libolibong pagka
minsan hindi ko maintindihan
sa libulibong pagkakataon na tayoy nagkasama
iilang ulit palang kitang nakitang masaya
naiinis akong isipin na ginaganyan ka ya
siguro ay hindi niya lang alam ang iyong
tunay na halaga
sa libolibong pagka
uso pa ba ang harana marahil ikaw ay nag tataka
sino ba tong mukang gago nag kandarapa
sa pagkanta at nasisintunado sa kaba
meron pang dalang mga rosas suot namay
maong na kupas
at nariyan pa ang barkada naka porma't naka barong
sa awiting daig pa ang minus one at sing along
puno ang langit ng bitwin at kay lamig pa ng hangin
sa iyong tingin akoy nababaliw giliw
at sa awitin kong ito sanay maibigan mo
ibubuhos ko ang buong puso ko sa isang
munting harana para sa iyo
hindi bat parang isang sine isang pelikulang romantiko
hindi bat ikaw ang bidang artista
at ako ang iyong leading man
sa istoryang nagwawakas sa pag ibig na wagas
puno ang langit ng bitwin at kay lamig pa ng hangin
sa iyong tingin akoy nababaliw giliw
at sa awitin kong ito sanay maibigan mo
ibubuhos ko ang buong puso ko sa isang
munting harana para sa iyo
hello dan it's joe here
i hope you're keeping well
it’s the of december
now they’re ringing the last bell
if i get good behaviour
i'll be out of here by july
won’t you kiss my kids on christmas day
please don't let them cry for me
i guess the brothers are driving down from queensland
and stella's flying in from the coast
they say it's gonna be a hundred degrees even more maybe
but that won't stop the roast
who's gonna make the gravy now
i bet it won't taste the same
just add flour salt a little red wine and don't forget a
dollop of tomato sauce for sweetness and that extra tang
and give my love to angus and to frank and dolly
tell 'em all i'm sorry i screwed up this time
and look after rita i'll be thinking of her
early christmas morning when i'm standing in line
i hear mary's got a new boyfriend
i hope he can hold his own
do you remember the last one what was his name again
just a little too much cologne
and roger you know i'm even gonna miss roger
'cause there's sure as hell no one in here i want to fight
oh praise the baby jesus have a merry christmas
i'm really gonna miss it all the treasure and the trash
and later in the evening i can just imagine
you'll put on junior murvin and push the tables back
and you'll dance with rita i know you really like her
just don't hold her too close oh brother please don't stab me in the back
i didn't mean to say that it's just my mind it plays up
multiplies each matter turns imagination into fact
you know i love her badly she's the one to save me
i'm gonna make some gravy i'm gonna taste the fat
tell her that i'm sorry yeah i love her badly
tell 'em all i'm sorry and kiss the sleepy children for me
you know one of these days i'll be making gravy
i'll be making plenty i'm gonna pay 'em all back
harness your hopes on just one person
because you know a harness was only made for one
don't telegraph your passes you'll end up with molasses
cauterized with syrup and syrup and molasses
and i'm checking out the asses the assets that attract us
to anything that moves we're deep inside the grooves
and it's time to shake the rations 'cause someone's gonna cash in
the plot it turns again the reference starts at ten
show me a word that rhymes with pavement
and i won't kill your parents and roast them on a spit
and a don't you try to etch it or permanently sketch it
or you're gonna catch a bad bad cold
and the freaks have stormed the white house i moved into a lighthouse
it's on a scenic quay is oh so far away
far away from the beginning the shroud is made of linen
the yearling took the purse the goth kid has a hearse
heart breaking earth quaking kiwis they are home baking
minds wide open truly
leisure a leisure suit is nothing
it's nothing to be proud of in this late century
and i'm asking you to hold me just like the morning paper
pinched between your pointer your index and your thumb
it's a semi automatic believers are ecstatic
you see the way they cling the cold metallic sting
and i'm living in a coma for donna devorona
the harness made of hopes the lovers on the ropes
nun is to church as the parrot is to perch
and my heart's wide open truly

haunting familiar yet i cant seem to place it
cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
lifetimes are catchin' up with me
all these changes taking place
i wish i’d seen the place
but noone’s ever taken me
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
i swear i recognise your breath
memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
me you wouldn't recall for i'm not my former
it's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf
i changed by not changing at all
small town predicts my fate
perhaps that's what no one wants to see
i just want to scream "hello"
my god it's been so long never dreamed you'd return
but now here you are and here i am
hearts and thoughts they fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away

once divided nothing left to subtract
some words when spoken can't be taken back
walks on his own with thoughts he can't help thinking
future's above but in the past he's slow and sinking
caught a bolt of lightning cursed the day he let it go
nothingman nothingman
isn't it something nothingman
she once believed in every story he had to tell
one day she stiffened took the other side
empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell
one just escapes one's left inside the well
and he who forgets will be destined to remember oh oh oh oh
nothingman nothingman
isn't it something nothingman
oh she don't want him she don't want him
oh she won't feed him after he's flown away

where were you when i was burned and broken
while the days slipped by from my window watching
where were you when i was hurt and i was helpless
because the things you say and the things you do surround me
while you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
dying to believe in what you heard
i was staring straight into the shining sun
lost in thought and lost in time
while the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
outside the rain fell dark and slow
while i pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
i took a heavenly ride through our silence
i knew the moment had arrived
for killing the past and coming back to life
i took aheavenly ride through our silence
i knew the waiting had begun
and headed straight into the shining sun
sucker love is heaven sent
you pucker up our passion's spent
my hearts a tart your body's rent
my body's broken yours is spent
carve your name into my arm
instead of stressed i lie here charmed
cuz there's nothing else to do
every me and every you
sucker love a box i choose
no other box i choose to use
another love i would abuse
no circumstances could excuse
in the shape of things to come
too much poison come undone
cuz there's nothing else to do
every me and every you
every me and every you
every mehee
sucker love is known to swing
prone to cling and waste these things
pucker up for heavens sake
there's never been so much at stake
i serve my head up on a plate
it's only comfort calling late
cuz there's nothing else to do
every me and every you
every me and every you
every mehee
every me and every you
every mehee
like the naked leads the blind
i know i'm selfish i'm unkind
sucker love i always find
someone to bruise and leave behind
all alone in space and time
there's nothing here but what here's here's mine
something borrowed something blue
every me and every you
every me and every you
every mehee
every me and every you
every mehee times

she came from greece she had a thirst for knowledge
that's where i caught her eye
she told me that her dad was loaded
she said "fine" and in a thirty seconds time she said
"i want to live like common people
i want to do whatever common people do
i want to sleep with common people like you"
well what else could i do i said "i'll see what i can do"
i took her to a supermarket
i don't know why but i had to start it somewhere so it started there
i said "pretend you've got no money"
i said "yeah well i can't see someone else smiling in here
are you sure you want to live like common people
you want to see whatever common people see
you want to sleep with common people like me"
but she didn't understand she just smiled and held my hand
rent a flat above your shop cut your hair and get a job
smoke some fags and play some pool pretend you never went to school
but still you'll never get it right 'cos when you're laid in bed at night
watching roaches climb the wall if you called your dad he could stop it all
you'll never live like common people
you'll never do whatever common people do
you'll never watch your life slide out of view
and dance and drink and screw because there's nothing else to do
sing along with the common people
sing along and it might just get you thru
laugh along even though they are laughing at you
because you think that poor is cool
like a dog lying in a corner they will bite you and never warn you
look out they'll tear your insides out
'cos everybody hates a tourist especially one who thinks that it's all
such a laugh
you will never understand how it feels to live your life
with no meaning or control and with nowhere left to go
you are amazed that they exist and they burn so bright
whilst you can only wonder why
rent a flat above your shop cut your hair and get a job
smoke some fags and play some pool pretend you never went to school
but still you'll never get it right 'cos when you're laid in bed at night
watching roaches climb the wall if you called your dad he could stop it all
you'll never live like common people
you'll never do whatever common people do
you'll never watch your life slide out of view
and dance and drink and screw because there's nothing else to do
empty spaces what are we living for
abandoned places i guess we know the score
on and on does anybody know what we are looking for
another hero another mindless crime
behind the curtain in the pantomime
hold the line does anybody want to take it anymore
the show must go on the show must go on yeah
inside my heart is breaking
my makeup may be flaking
but my smile still stays on
whatever happens i'll leave it all to chance
another heartache another failed romance
on and on does anybody know what we are living for
i guess i'm learning i must be warmer now
i'll soon be turning round the corner now
outside the dawn is breaking
but inside in the dark i'm aching to be free
the show must go on the show must go on yeah
inside my heart is breaking
my makeup may be flaking
but my smile still stays on
my soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
i can fly my friends
the show must go on the show must go on yeah
i'll face it with a grin
i'm never giving in
on with the show
i'll top the bill i'll overkill
i have to find the will to carry on
the show must go on

when the day is long and the night the night is yours alone
when you're sure you've had enough of this life well hang on

don't let yourself go everybody cries
and everybody hurts sometimes
sometimes everything is wrong now it's time to sing along
when your day is night alone hold on hold on
if you feel like letting go hold on
when you think you've had too much of this life well hang on

everybody hurts take comfort in your friends
everybody hurts
don't throw your hand oh no don't throw your hand
when you feel like you're alone no no no you are not alone
if you're on your own in this life the days and nights are long
when you think you've had too much of this life to hang on

well everybody hurts sometimes
everybody cries everybody hurts sometimes
but everybody hurts sometimes so hold on hold on hold on
hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
everybody hurts
you are not alone

spread my wings and fly away
i believe i can soar
i see me running through that open door
i believe i can fly
i believe i can fly

in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns
he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins
it wears him out

they're the ones who'll spit at you you will be the one screaming out

before we all go under

she's always on my mind
from the time i awake up 'till i close my eyes
she's everywhere i go
she's all i know
and though she's so far away
it just keeps gettin' stronger everyday
and even now she's gone
i'm still holding on
so tell me where do i start
'cause it's breakin' my heart
don't wanna let her go
maybe my love will come back someday
only heaven knows
and maybe our hearts will find a way
only heaven knows
and all i can do is hope and pray
'cause heaven knows
my friends keep tellin' me
that if you really love her
you've gotta set her free
and if she returns in kind
i'll know she's mine
but tell me where do i start
'cause it's breakin' my heart
don't wanna let her go
maybe my love will come back someday
only heaven knows
and maybe our hearts will find a way
only heaven knows
and all i can do is hope and pray
'cause heaven knows
why i live in despair
'cause wide awake or dreaming
i know she's never there
and all the time i act so brave
i'm shaking inside
why does it hurt me so
maybe my love will come back someday
only heaven knows
and maybe our hearts will find a way
only heaven knows
and all i can do is hope and pray
'cause heaven knows
am i real

make you feelthat the love
i have for you will see no ending
well if you look into my eyes
then you should know
that there is nothing here to doubt

we can fade into the night and you'll know
the world could die
and everything may lie

i'll be by your side
take my hand
and gently close your eyes
so you could understand
that there's no greater love tonight

we can journey to a garden no one knows
life is short my darlin tell me that you love me
so we can fade into the night and youll know
the world could die
and everything may lie

coz time may pass
but longer it'll last

and everything may lie
still you shan't cry
coz time may pass

i sit and wait
does an angel contemplate my fate
and do they know
when we´re grey and old
´cos i´ve been told
that salvation lets their wings unfold
so when i’m lying in my bed
thoughts running through my head
and i feel that love is dead
i’m loving angels instead
and through it all she offers me protection
a lot of love and affection
whether i’m right or wrong
and down the waterfall
wherever it may take me
i know that life wont break me
when i come to call she wont forsake me
i’m loving angels instead
when i’m feeling weak
and my pain walks down a one way street
i look above
and i know ill always be blessed with love
and as the feeling grows
she breathes flesh to my bones
and when love is dead
i’m loving angels instead
and through it all she offers me protection
a lot of love and affection
whether i’m right or wrong
and down the waterfall
wherever it may take me
i know that life wont break me
when i come to call she wont forsake me
i’m loving angels instead
and through it all she offers me protection
a lot of love and affection
whether i’m right or wrong
and down the waterfall
wherever it may take me
i know that life wont break me
when i come to call she wont forsake me
i’m loving angels instead

man it's a hot one
like seven inches from the midday sun
i hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
but you stay so cool
my munequita my spanish harlem mona lisa
your my reason for reason
the step in my groove
and if you say this life ain't good enough
i would give my world to lift you up
i could change my life to better suit your mood
cause you're so smooth
and it's just like the ocean under the moon
well that's the same as the emotion that i get from you
you got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
gimme your heart make it real
or else forget about it
i'll tell you one thing
if you would leave it would be a crying shame
in every breath and every word i hear your name
calling me out
out from the barrio you hear my rhythm from your radio
you feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
turning you round and round
and if you say this life ain't good enough
i would give my world to lift you up
i could change my life to better suit your mood
cause you're so smooth
and it's just like the ocean under the moon
well that's the same as the emotion that i get from you
you got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
gimme your heart make it real

well that's the same as the emotion that i get from you
you got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
gimme your heart make it real
or else forget about it
or else forget about it
fade
spend all your time waiting for that second chance
for a break that would make it okay
there's always some reason to feel not good enough
and it's hard at the end of the day
i need some distraction oh a beautiful release
memories seep from my veins
let me be empty oh and weightless and maybe i'll find some peace tonight
in the arms of the angel fly away from here
from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you feel
you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie
you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here
so tired of the straight line and everywhere you turn
there's vultures and thieves at your back
the storm keeps on twisting keep on building the lies
that you make up for all that you lack
don't make no difference escape one last time
it's easier to believe
in this sweet madness oh this glorious sadness
that brings me to my knees
in the arms of the angel fly away from here
from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you feel
you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie
you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here
you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here

maybe it's intuition
but some things you just don't question
like in your eyes
i see my future in an instant
and there it goes
i think i've found my best friend
i know that it might sound more than a little crazy
but i believe
i knew i loved you before i met you
i think i dreamed you into life
i knew i loved you before i met you
i have been waiting all my life
there's just no rhyme or reason
only this sense of completion
and in your eyes
i see the missing pieces
i'm seaching for
i think i've found my way home
i know that it might sound more than a little crazy
but i believe
i knew i loved you before i met you
i think i dreamed you into life
i knew i loved you before i met you
i have been waiting all my life
ooooh ooh aaaaah
a thousand angels dance around you

i will be strong i will be faithful 'cos i'm counting on
a new beginning
a reason for living
a deeper meaning
i want to stand with you on a mountain
i want to bathe with you in the sea
i want to lay like this forever
until the sky falls down on me
and when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
i'll make a wish send it to heaven then make you want to cry
the tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
that we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of
the highest power
in lonely hours
the tears devour you
i want to stand with you on a mountain
i want to bathe with you in the sea
i want to lay like this forever
until the sky falls down on me

i'll love you more with every breath truly madly deeply do
i want to stand with you on a mountain
i want to bathe with you in the sea
i want to lay like this forever
until the sky falls down on me
i follow the moskva
down to gorky park
listening to the wind of change
an august summer night
soldiers passing by
listening to the wind of change
the world is closing in
did you ever think
that we could be so close like brothers
the future's in the air
i can feel it everywhere
blowing with the wind of change
take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change
walking down the street
distant memories
are buried in the past forever
i follow the moskva
down to gorky park
listening to the wind of change
take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
with you and me
take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change
the wind of change blows straight
into the face of time
like a stormwind that will ring
the freedom bell for peace of mind
let your balalaika sing
what my guitar wants to say
take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
with you and me
take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change

look how far we've come my baby
i've been long a long way from here
put on a poncho played for mosquitoes
and drank 'til i was thirsty again
we went searching through thrift store jungles
found geronimo's rifle marilyn's shampoo
and benny goodman's corset and pen
well ok i made this up… i promised you i'd never give up
if it makes you happy it can't be that baaaaaad
if it makes you happy then why the hell are you so sad
you get down real low down
you listen to coltrane derail your own train
well who hasn't been there before
i come round around the hard way
bring you comics in bed scrape the mold off the bread
and serve you french toast again
well ok i still get stoned… i'm not the kind of girl you'd take home
if it makes you happy it can't be that baaaaaad
if it makes you happy then why the hell are you so sad
we've been far far away from here
put on a poncho played for mosquitoes
and everywhere in between
well ok we get along… so what if right now everything's wrong
if it makes you happy it can't be that baaaaaad
if it makes you happy then why the hell are you so sad
it's twelve o'clock and it's a wonderful day
i know you hate me but i'll ask anyway
won't you come with me to a place in a little town
the only way to get there's to go straight down
there's no bathroom and there is no sink
the water out of the tap is very hard to drink
very hard to drink
you wait til tomorrow
you wait til tomorrow
you say that money isn't everything
but i'd like to see you live without it
you think you can keep on going living like a king
oohh babe but i strongly doubt it
very hard to drink
very hard to drink
you gonna wait til fat boy
fat boy wait until tomorrow
you gonna wait til fat boy
fat boy wait until tomorrow
you wait til tomorrow
you wait til tomorrow
you gonna wait til fat boy
fat boy wait until tomorrow
you gonna wait til fat boy
fat boy wait until tomorrow

finally i figured out
but it took a long long time
but now there's a turnabout
maybe cause i'm trying
there's been times i'm so confused
and all my roads well they lead to you
i just can't turn and walk away
it's hard to say what it is i see in you
wonder if i'll always be with you
words can't say and i can't do
enough to prove
it's all for you
and i thought i'd seen it all
'cause it's been a long long time
oh but then we'll trip and fall
wondering if i'm blind
there's been times i'm so confused
and all my roads well they lead to you
i just can't turn and walk away
it's hard to say what it is i see in you
wonder if i'll always be with you
words can't say and i can't do
enough to prove
it's all for you
rain comes pouring down
falling from blue skies
words without a sound
coming from your eyes
finally i figured out
but it took a long long time
oh now there's a turnabout
maybe cause i'm trying
there's been times i'm so confused
and all my roads well they lead to you
i just can't turn and walk away
it's hard to say what it is i see in you
well it's hard to say what it is i see in you
wonder if i'll always be with you
words can't say and i can't do
enough to prove
it's all for you
whoa it's hard to say
whoa it's hard to say
it's all for you
kiss me out of the bearded barley
nightly beside the green green grass
swing swing swing the spinning step
you wear those shoes and i will wear that dress
ohoh kiss me beneath the milky twilight
lead me out on the moonlit floor
lift your open hand
strike up the band make the fireflies dance silver moon's sparkling
so kiss
me
kiss me down by the broken tree house
swing me upon its hanging tire
bring bring bring your flowered hat
we'll take the trail marked on your father's map
ohoh kiss me beneath the milky twilight
lead me out on the moonlit floor
lift your open hand
strike up the band make the fireflies dance silver moon's sparkling
so kiss
me
kiss me beneath the milky twilight
lead me out on the moonlit floor
lift your open hand
strike up the band make the fireflies dance silver moon's sparkling
so kiss
me so kiss
me so kiss
me so kiss
me

listen close and don't be stoned
i'll be here in the morning
cause i'm just floating
your cigarette still burns
your messedup world will thrill me
alison i'm lost
alison i said we're sinking
there's nothing here but that's okay
outside your room your sister's spinning
but she lies tells me she's just fine
i guess she's out there somewhere
and the sailors they strike poses
tv covered walls and so slowly
with your talking and your pills
your messedup life still thrills me
alison i'm lost
alison i'll drink your wine
i wear your clothes when we're both high
alison i said we're sinking
but you laugh and tells me it's just fine
i guess she's out there somewhere
somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
i ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
she was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her
thumb in the shape of an "l" on her forehead
well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
fed to the rules and i hit the ground running
didn't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do so much to see
so what's wrong with taking the back streets
you'll never know if you don't go
you'll never shine if you don't glow
hey now you're an all star get your game on go play
hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
and all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
it's a cool place and they say it gets colder
you're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
but the meteor men beg to differ
judging by the hole in the satellite picture
the ice we skate is getting pretty thin
the waters getting warm so you might as well swim
my world's on fire how about yours
that's the way i like it and i never get bored
hey now you're an all star get your game on go play
hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
hey now you're an all star get your game on go play
hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
and all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars
somebody once asked could i spare some change for gas
i need to get myself away from this place
i said yep what a concept i could use a little fuel myself
and we could all use a little change
well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
fed to the rules and i hit the ground running
didn't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do so much to see
so what's wrong with taking the back streets
you'll never know if you don't go go
you'll never shine if you don't glow
hey now you're an all star get your game on go play
hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
and all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
and all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
over the mountains and the sea
your river runs with love for me
and i will open up my heart
and let the healer set me free
i'm happy to be in the truth
and i will daily lift my hands
for i will always sing of when
i could sing of your love forever
i could sing of your love forever
i could sing of your love forever
i could sing of your love forever
oh i feel like dancing hey yeaah
it's foolishness i know
but when the world has seen the light
they will dance with joy
like we're dancing now
open the eyes of my heart lord
open the eyes of my heart
i want to see you i want to see you
open the eyes of my heart lord
open the eyes of my heart
i want to see you i want to see you
to see you high and lifted up
shining in the light of your glory
pour out your pow'r and love
as we sing holy holy holy
holy holy holy
holy holy holy
holy holy holy
i want to see you
i want to see you
i want to see you
i want to see you
call you up in the middle of the night
like a firefly without a light
you were there like a blowtorch burnin'
i was a key that could use a little turnin'
so tired that i couldn't even sleep
so many secrets i couldn't keep
promised myself i wouldn't weep
one more promise i couldn't keep
it seems no one can help me now
i'm in too deep there's no way out
this time i have really led myself astray
runaway train never going back
wrong way on a oneway track
seems like i should be getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither here nor there
can you help me remember how to smile
make it somehow all seem worthwhile
how on earth did i get so jaded
life's mysteries seem so faded
i can go where no one else can go
i know what no one else knows
here i am just drowning in the rain
with a ticket for a runaway train
and everything seems cut and dry
day and night earth and sky
somehow i just don't believe it
runaway train never going back
wrong way on a oneway track
seems like i should be getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither here nor there
bought a ticket for a runaway train
like a madman laughing at the rain
little out of touch little insane
it's just easier than dealing with the pain
runaway train never going back
wrong way on a oneway track
seems like i should be getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither here nor there
runaway train never coming back
runaway train tearing up the track
runaway train burning in my veins
i'd runaway but it always seems the same
repeat and fade out
in my eyes indisposed
in disguises no one knows
hides the face lies the snake
the sun in my disgrace
boiling heat summer stench
neath the black the sky looks dead
call my name through the cream
and i'll hear you scream again
black hole sun
won't you come
and wash away the rain
black hole sun
won't you come won't you come won't you come
stuttering cold and damp
steal the warm wind tired friend
times are gone for honest men
and sometimes far too long for snakes
in my shoes a walking sleep
and my youth i pray to keep
heaven sent hell away
no one sings like you anymore
black hole sun
won't you come
and wash away the rain
black hole sun
won't you come won't you come
black hole sun
won't you come
and wash away the rain
black hole sun
won't you come
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
hang my head drown my fear
till you all just disappear
black hole sun
won't you come
and wash away the rain
black hole sun
won't you come won't you come
black hole sun
won't you come
and wash away the rain
black hole sun
won't you come
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
won't you come black hole sun black hole sun
won't you come

you'll remember me when the west wind moves
upon the fields of barley
you'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
as we walk in the fields of gold
so she took her love for to gaze awhile
upon the fields of barley
in his arms she fell as her hair came down
among the fields of gold
will you stay with me will you be my love
among the fields of barley
we'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
as we lie in the fields of gold
see the west wind move like a lover so
upon the fields of barley
feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
among the fields of gold
i never made promises lightly
and there have been some that i've broken
but i swear in the days still left
we'll walk in fields of gold
we'll walk in fields of gold
e||
many years have passed since those summer days
among the fields of barley
see the children run as the sun goes down
among the fields of gold
you'll remember me when the west wind moves
upon the fields of barley
you can tell the sun in his jealous sky
when we walked in fields of gold
when we walked in fields of gold
when we walked in fields of gold
if the night turned cold and the stars looked down
and you hugh yourself on the cold cold ground
you wake the morning in a stranger's coat
no one would you see
you ask yourself who'd watch for me
my only friend who could it be
it's hard to say it
i hate to say it but it's probably me
you're not the easiest person i ever got to know
and it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
some would say i should let you go your way
you'll only make me cry
if there's one guy just one guy
who'd lay down his life for you and die
it's hard to say it
it's hard to say it but it's probably me
if there's one guy just one guy
who'd lay down his life for you and die
it's hard to say it
i hate to say it but it's probably me
i hate to say it
i hate to say it but it's probably me

he deals the cards as a meditation
and those he plays never suspect
he doesnt play for the mo ney he wins
he doesnt play for respect
he deals the cards to find the answer
the sacred geometry of chance
the hidden law of a pro bable outcome
the numbers lead a dance
i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
i know that diamonds mean mo ney for this art
but thats not the shape of my heart
and he may play the jack of diamonds
he may lay the queen of spades
he may conceal a king in his hand
while a memory of it fades
i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
i know that diamonds mean mo ney for this art
but thats not the shape of my heart
and if i told you that i loved you
you'd maybe think theres something wrong
i'm not a man of two many faces
the mask i wear is one
but those who speak know nothing
and find out to their cost
and those who curse their luck in too many places
are those who fear are lost

how deep the father's love for us how vast beyond all measure
that he should give his only son to make a wretch his treasure
how great the pain of searing loss the father turned his face away
as wounds which mar the chosen one bring many sons to glory
behold the man upon a cross my sin upon his shoulders
ashamed i hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers
it was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished
his dying breath has brought me life i know that it is finished
i will not boast in anything no gifts no power no wisdom
but i will boast in jesus christ his death and resurrection
why should i gain from his reward i cannot give an answer
but this i know with all my heart his wounds have paid my ransom
when you grab a hold of me
tell me that i'll never be set free
well i'm a parasite

aint got no quarrels with god
ain't got no time to grow old
lord knows i'm weak
wont somebody get me off of this reef
ain't got no quarrels with god
ain't got no time to get old
lord knows i'm weak
wont somebody get me off of this reef

like cleopatra joan of arc or aphrodite

high above me she's so lovely
she's so high
like cleopatra joan of arc or aphrodite

this is the greatest and best song in the world tribute
long time ago me and my brother kyle here
we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
all of a sudden there shined a shiny demon
in the middle of the road
and he said
"play the best song in the world or i'll eat your souls"
well me and kyle we looked at each other
and we each said "okay"
and we played the first thing that came to our heads
just so happened to be
the best song in the world it was the best song in the world
look into my eyes and it's easy to see
one and one make two two and one make three
it was destiny
once every hundredthousand years or so
when the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
and the grass don't grow
needless to say the beast was stunned
whipcrack went his schwumpy tail
and the beast was done
he asked us "be you angels"
and we said "nay we are but men" rock
ahhh ahhh ahhhahah
ohhh whoah ahwhoahoh
this is not the greatest song in the world
no this is just a tribute
couldn't remember the greatest song in the world
no this is a tribute oh
to the greatest song in the world all right
it was the greatest song in the world all right
it was the best muthafuckin' song
the greatest song in the world
and the peculiar thing is this my friends
the song we sang on that fateful night
it didn't actually sound anything like this song
this is just a tribute you gotta' believe me
and i wish you were there just a matter of opinion
ah fuck good god god lovin'
so surprised to find you can't stop it

another head hangs lowly child is slowly taken
and the violence caused such silence who are we mistaken
but you see it's not me it's not my family

with their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
in your head in your head they're dying
in your head in your head zombie zombie zombie

by a lonely prison wall i heard a young girl calling
michael they have taken you away
for you stole trevelyan's corn so the young might see the morn'
now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay
low lie the fields of athenry
where once we watched the small free birds fly
our love was on the wing
we had dreams and songs to sing
it's so lonely round the fields of athenry
by a lonely prison wall i heard a young man calling
nothing matters mary when you're free
against the famine and the crown i rebelled they cut me down
now you must raise our child with dignity
low lie the fields of athenry
where once we watched the small free birds fly
our love was on the wing
we had dreams and songs to sing
it's so lonely round the fields of athenry
by a lonely harbor wall she watched the last star falling
as the prison ship sailed out against the sky
for she'd live in hope and pray for her love in botany bay
it's so lonely round the fields of athenry
low lie the fields of athenry
where once we watched the small free birds fly
our love was on the wing
we had dreams and songs to sing
it's so lonely round the fields of athenry
low lie the fields of athenry
where once we watched the small free birds fly
our love was on the wing
we had dreams and songs to sing
it's so lonely round the fields of athenry
i was a highwayman along the coach roads i did ride
with sword and pistol by my side
many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
the bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
but i am still alive
i was a sailor i was born upon the tide
with the sea i did abide
i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico
i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
and when the yards broke off they said that i got killed
but i am living still
i was a dam builder across a river deep and wide
where steel and water did collide
a place called boulder on the wild colorado
i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
they buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
but i am still around
i'll always be around and around and around and around
and around and around
i'll fly a starship 'cross the universe divide
and when i reach the other side
i'll find a place to rest my spirit if i can
perhaps i may become a highwayman again
or i may simply be a single drop of rain
but i will remain
and i'll be back again and again and again and again
and again and again

i wish i had your pair of wings
had them last night in my dreams
i was chasing butterflies
till the sunrise broke my eyes
tonight the sky has glued my eyes
cause what they sees an angel hive
i've got to touch that magic sky
and greet the angels in their hive
sometimes i wish i were an angel
sometimes i wish i were you
sometimes i wish i were an angel
sometimes i wish i were you
and all the sweet honey from above
pour it all over me sweet love
and while you're flying around my head
your honey kisses keep my fed
i wish i had your pair of wings
just like last night in my dreams
i was lost in paradise
wish i'd never opened my eyes
sometimes i wish i were an angel
sometimes i wish i were you
sometimes i wish i were an angel
sometimes i wish i were you
but there's danger in the air
tryin' so hard to be unfair
danger's in the air
tryin' so hard to give us a scare
but we're not afraid
sometimes i wish i were an angel
sometimes i wish i were you
sometimes i wish i were an angel
sometimes i wish
i were you

the book of love is long and boring
no one can lift the damn thing
it's full of charts and facts and figures
and instructions for dancing but
i
i love it when you read to me and
you
you can read me anything
the book of love has music in it
in fact that's where music comes from
some of it is just transcendental
some of it is just really dumb but
i
i love it when you sing to me and
you
you can sing me anything
the book of love is long and boring
and written very long ago
it's full of flowers and heartshaped boxes
and things we're all too young to know but
i
i love it when you give me things and
you
you ought to give me wedding rings
i
i love it when you give me things and
you
you ought to give me wedding rings
lala laalaala lalaa laalaalala
i wrote her off for the tenth time today
and practice all the things i would say
when she came over i lost my nerve
i took her back and made her dessert
now i know i'm being used
that's okay man cause i like the abuse
i know she's playing with me
that's okay 'cause i got no self esteem
we make plans to go out at night
i wait till then i turn out the light
all this rejection's got me so low
if she keeps it up i just might tell her so
when she's saying oh that she wants only me
then i wonder why she sleeps with my friends
when she's saying oh that i'm like a disease
then i wonder how much more i can spend
well i guess i should stick up for myself
but i really think it's better this way
the more you suffer the more it shows you really care
right yeah yeah yeah
now i'll relate this little bit
that happens more than i'd like to admit
late at night she knocks on my door
she's drunk again and looking to score
now i know i should say no
but that's kind of hard when she's ready to go
i may be dumb but i'm not a dweeb
i'm just a sucker with no self esteem
when she's saying oh that she wants only me
then i wonder why she sleeps with my friends
when she's saying oh that i'm like a disease
then i wonder how much more i can spend
well i guess i should stick up for myself
but i really think it's better this way
the more you suffer the more it shows you really care
right yeah yeah yeah

shakedown nineteen seven nine
cool kids never have the time
on a live wire right up off the street
you and i should meet
junebug skipping like a stone
with headlights pointed at the dawn
we were sure we'd never see
an end to it all
and i don't even care to shake these zipper blues
and we don't know just where our bones will rest
to dust i guess
forgotten and absorbed into the earth below
double cross the vacant and the bored
they're not sure just what we have in store
morphine city slippin' dues down to see
that we don't even care as restless as we are
we feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
and poured cement
lamented and assured
to the lights and towns below
faster than the speed of sound
faster than we thought we'd go beneath the sound of hope
justine never knew the rules
hung down with the freaks and ghouls
no apologies ever need be made
i know you better than you fake it to see
that we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
and we don't know just where our bones will rest
to dust i guess
forgotten and absorbed into the earth below
the street heats the urgency of now
as you see there's no one around
disarm you with a smile and cut you like you want me to
cut that little child inside of me and such a part of you
oh hoo the years burn
oh hoo the years burn
i used to be a little boy so old in my shoes
and what i choose is my choice what's a boy supposed to do
the killer in me is the killer in you my love
i send this smile over to you
disarm you with a smile and leave you like they left me here
to whither in denial the bitterness of one who's left alone
oh hoo the years burn
oh hoo the years burn burn burn
i used to be a little boy so old in my shoes
and what i choose is my voice what's a boy supposed to do
the killer in me is the killer in you my love
i send this smile over to you
the killer in me is the killer in you
i send this smile over to you
the killer in me is the killer in you
i send this smile over to you
the killer in me is the killer in you
i send this smile over to you

today is the greatest day i've ever known
can't live for tomorrow tomorrow's much too long
i'll burn my eyes out
before i get out
i wanted more than life could ever grant me
bored by the chore of saving face
today is the greatest day i've ever known
can't wait for tomorrow i might not have that long
i'll tear my heart out before i get out
pink ribbon scars that never forget
i've tried so hard to cleanse these regrets
my angel wings were bruised and restrained
my belly stings
today is today is today is the greatest
day heeyay oo oo ooo ooo ooo day heeyayay hooo
i want to turn you on i want to turn you on
i want to turn you on i want to turn you
today is the greatest today is the greatest day
today is the greatest day i have ever really known

i left your house this morning about a quarter after nine
could've been the willie nelson could've been the wine
when i left your house this morning
it was a little after nine
it was in bobcaygeon i saw the constellations
reveal themselves one star at a time
drove back to town this morning with working on my mind
i thought of maybe quitting
thought of leaving it behind
went back to bed this morning
and as i'm pulling down the blind
the sky was dull and hypothetical
and falling one cloud at a time
that night in toronto with its checkerboard floors
riding on horseback and keeping order restored
til the men they couldn't hang
stepped to the mic and sang
and their voices rang with that aryan twang
i got to your house this morning just a little after nine
in the middle of that riot
couldn't get you off my mind
so i'm at your house this morning
just a little after nine
cause it was in bobcaygeon where i saw the constellations
reveal themselves one star at a time
sundown in the paris of the prairies
wheat kings have all their treasures buried
and all you hear are the rusty breezes
pushing around the weathervane jesus
in his zippo lighter he sees the killer's face
maybe it's someone standing in the killers place
twenty years for nothing well that's nothing new besides
no one's interested in something you didn't do
wheat kings and pretty things
let's just see what the morning brings
there's a dream he dreams where the high school is dead and stark
it's a museum and we're all locked up in it after dark
where the walls are lined all yellow grey and sinister
hung with pictures of our parents' prime ministers
wheat kings and pretty things
wait and see what tomorrow brings
late breaking story on the cbc
a nation whispers "we always knew that he'd go free"
they add "you can't be fond of living in the past
cause if you are then there's no way that you're gonna last"
wheat kings and pretty things
let's just see what tomorrow brings
wheat kings and pretty things
ah that's what tomorrow brings

so long ago i don't remember when
that's when they say i lost my only friend
well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
as i listened through the cemetery trees
i seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn
the long broken arm of human law
now it always seemed such a waste she always had a pretty face
i wondered how she hung around this place
hey
come on try a little
nothing is forever
got to be something better than
me cinderella
put it all together
we can drive it home
with one headlight
she said it's cold
it feels like independence day
and i can't break away from this parade
but there's got to be an opening
somewhere here in front of me
through this maze of ugliness and greed
and i seen the sun up ahead
at the county line bridge
sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
we'll run until she's out of breath
she ran until there's nothin' left
she hit the endit's just her window ledge
hey hey
come on try a little
nothing is forever
got to be something better than
me cinderella
put it all together
we can drive it home
with one headlight
well this place is old
it feels just like a beat up truck
i turn the engine but the engine doesn't turn
well it smells of cheap wine cigarettes
this place is always such a mess
sometimes i think i'd like to watch it burn
i'm so alone and i feel just like somebody else
man i ain't changed but i know i ain't the same
but somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
i think her death it must be killin' me
hey hey hey
come on try a little
nothing is forever
got to be something better than
me cinderella
put it all together
we can drive it home
with one headlight
repeat and fade
oh jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh
jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh
dashing through the snow
in a one horse open sleigh
o'er the fields we go
laughing all the way
bells on bob tails ring
making spirits bright
what fun it is to laugh and sing
a sleighing song tonight
oh jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh
jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh
you doin' that thing you do
breakin' my heart into a million pieces
like you always do
and you don't mean to be cruel
you never even knew about the heartache
i've been goin' through
well i try and try to forget you girl
but it's just so hard to do
every time you do that thing you do
i know all the games you play
and i'm gonna find a way to let you know that
you'll be mine some day
'cause we could be happy can't you see
if you'd only let me be the one to hold you
and keep you here with me
well i try and try to forget you girl
but it's just so hard to do
every time you do that thing you do
i don't ask a lot girl i don't ask a lot girl
but i know one thing's for sure know one thing's for sure
it's your love i haven't got girl
and i just can't take it anymore wow
'cause we could be happy can't you see
if you'd only let me be the one to hold you
and keep you here with me
cause it hurts me so just to see you go
around with someone new
and if i know you you're doin' that thing
every day just doin' that thing
i can't take you doin' that thing you do

e|||
i'm only pretty sure that i can't take anymore before you
take a swing i wonder what are we fighting
for when i say out loud i want to get out of this i wonder
i wonder is there anything i'm gonna miss
i wonder 'how's it gonna be when you don't know me'
how's it gonna be when you're sure i'm not there
how's it gonna be when there's no one there to talk to
between you and me 'cause i don't care how's it gonna
be
where we used to laugh there's a shouting match sharp as a thumbnail
scratch a silence i can't ignore like the hammock by the doorway
we spent time in swing's empty i don't see lightning like last fall
when it was always about to hit me
i wonder
how's it gonna be when it goes down
how's it gonna be when you're not around
how's it gonna be when you found out there was nothing
between you and me 'cause i don't care how's it gonna
be
how's it gonna be when you don't know me anymore
how's it gonna be
wanna get myself back in again
the soft dive of oblivion
i wanna taste the salt of your skin
the soft dive of oblivion oblivion
how's it gonna be when you don't know me anymore
how's it gonna be
how's it gonna be
i wish you would step back from that ledge my friend
you could cut ties with all the lies that you've been livin in aand
if you do not want to see me again
i will understaiaiand
i will understaiaiand
the angry boy a bit too insane
icing over a secret pain
you know you don't belong
you're the first to fight you're way too loud
you're the flash of light on a burial shroud
i know something's wrong
cuz everyone i know has got a reason to say
i wish you would step back from that ledge my friend
you could cut ties with all the lies that you've been livin in aand
if you do not want to see me again
i would understaiaiand
i would understaaaiaiand
well he's on the table and he's gone ta code
and i do not think anyone knows what they are
doing hereer
and your friends have left you've been dismissed
i never thought it would come to this and i
i want you to knowo
everyone's got to face down the demons maybe today
we can put the past away
i wish you would step back from that ledge my friend

i'm packed and i'm holding i'm smiling
she's living she's golden she lives for me
ovation her own motivation
she comes around and she goes down on me
and i make her smile like a drug for you
do ever what you want to do
coming over you
keep on smiling what we go through
one stop to the rhythm that divides you
and i speak to you like the chorus to the verse
chop another line like a coda with a curse
come on like a freak show takes the stage
i want something else
to get me through this
semicharmed kind of life baby baby
i want something else i'm not listening
when you say goodbye
doodoodoo doodoodoodoo
doodoodoo doodoodoodoo
doodoodoo doodoodoodoo
doodoodoo
the sky it was gold it was rose
i was taking sips of it through my nose
some place back there
smiling in the pictures you would take
doing crystal meth will lift
it won't stop i won't come down
i keep stock with a ticktock
and then i bumped up
i took the hit that i was given
then i bumped again
how do i get back there to
the place where i
fell asleep inside you
how do i get myself back to
the place where you said
i want something else
to get me through this
semicharmed kind of life baby baby
i want something else i'm not listening
when you say goodbye
i believe in the sand
beneath my toes
an earthy feeling
i believe in the
faith that grows
chords can make me cry
when i'm with you i
feel like i could die
all right all right
and when the plane came in
she said she was crashing
the velvet it rips in
the city we tripped
on the urge to feel alive
but now i'm struggling
those days you were wearing
that velvet dress
you're the priestess
i must confess
those little red panties
they pass the test
one
and you hold me and we're broken
still it's all that i wanna do just a little now
feel myself head
made of the ground
down no no and i won't
run for my life
she's got her jaws now
locked down in a smile
but nothing is alright alright
i want something else
to get me through this
life baby
i want something else
when you say goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
doodoodoo doodoodoodoo
doodoodoo doodoodoodoo
doodoodoo doodoodoodoo
the sky it was gold it was rose
i was taking sips of it through my nose
some place back there
in the place you used to start
doodoodoo doodoodoodoo
doodoodoo doodoodoodoo
i want something else
a scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
and is also known as a buster
always talkin' about what he wants
and just sits on his broke ass
so no
i don't want your number no
i don't want to give you mine and no
i don't want to meet you nowhere no
i don't want none of your time and no
i don't want no scrub
a scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
hangin' out the passenger side
of his best friend's ride
tryin' to holla at me
i don't want no scrub
a scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
hangin' out the passenger side
of his best friend's ride
tryin' to holler at me
there's a scrub checkin' me
his game is kinda weak
and i know that he cannot approach me
cuz i'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
can't get wit' a deadbeat ass
so no
i don't want your number no
i don't want to give you mine and no
i don't want to meet you nowhere no
i don't want none of your time and no
i don't want no scrub
a scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me

hangin' out the passenger side
of his best friend's ride
tryin' to holler at me
a lonely mother gazing out of her window
staring at a son that she just can't touch
if at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
but he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
but all the praying just ain't helping at all
'cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
so he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
another body laying cold in the gutter listen to me
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
little precious has a natural obsession
for temptation but he just can't see
she gives him loving that his body can't handle
but all he can say is "baby it's good to me"
one day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
but he doesn't recognize his own face
his health is fading and he doesn't know why
letters took him to his final resting place y'all don't hear me
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast c'mon
i seen a rainbow yesterday but too many storms have come and gone
leavin' a trace of not one godgiven ray is it because my life is ten shades of gray
i pray all ten fade away seldom praise him for the sunny days
and like his promise is true only my faith can undo
the many chances i blew to bring my life to anew
clear blue and unconditional skies have dried the tears from my eyes no more lonely cries
my only bleedin' hope is for the folk who can't cope
with such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
who's to blame for tootin' 'caine into your own vein
what a shame you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
you claim the insane and name this day in time for fallin' prey
to crime i say the system got you victim to your own mind
dreams are hopeless aspirations
in hopes of comin' true believe in yourself the rest is up to me and you
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
i'll bet you've never heard ole marshall dillon say
miss kitty have you ever thought of running away
settling down would you marry me
if i asked you twice and begged you pretty please
she'd have said yes in a new york minute
they never tied the knot
his heart wasn't in it
he just stole a kiss as he rode away
he never hung his hat up at kitty's place
i should've been a cowboy
i should've learned to rope and ride
wearing my sixshooter riding by pony on a cattle drive
stealing a young girl's heart
just like gene and roy
singing those campfire songs
oh i should've been a cowboy
i might of had a side kick with a funny name
running wild through the hills chasing jesse james
ending up on the brink of danger
riding shotgun for the texas rangers
go west young man haven't you been told

sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
a dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart
i should've been a cowboy

wearing my sixshooter riding by pony on a cattle drive
stealing a young girl's heart
just like gene and roy
singing those campfire songs

my mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
and i'm tired of pretending i don't love you anymore
let me make one last appeal
to show you how i feel about you hmm
'cause there's no one else i swear
holds a candle anywhere next to you hmm
my heart can't take the beating
not having you to hold
a small voice keeps repeating deep inside my soul
it says i can't keep pretending i don't love you anymore
i've got to take a chance or let it pass by
if i expect to get on with my life
my tears no longer waiting oh
my resistance ain't that strong
and my mind keeps recreating a love with you alone
and i'm tired of pretending i don't love you anymore

is it getting better
or do you feel the same
will it make it easier on you
now you got someone to blame you say
one love one life
when it's one need in the night
one love we got to share it
it leaves you baby if you don't care for it
did i disappoint you
or leave a bad taste in your mouth
you act like you never had love
and you want me to go without well it's
too late tonight
to drag the past out into the light
we're one but we're not the same
we got to carry each other carry each other
one
have you come here for forgiveness
have you come to raise the dead
have you come here to play jesus
to the lepers in your head
did i ask too much more than a lot
you gave me nothing now it's all i got
we're one but we're not the same
well we hurt each other then we do it again
you say love is a temple loves a higher law
love is a temple loves the higher law
you ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
and i can't be holding on
to what you got when all you got is hurt
one love one blood
one life you got to do what you should
one life with each other
sisters brothers
one life but we're not the same
we got to carry each other carry each other
one one
one

green light seveneleven
you stop in for a pack of cigarettes
you don't smoke don't even want to
hey now check your change
dressed up like a car crash
your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down
you say when he hits you you don't mind
because when he hurts you you feel alive
oh is that what it is
red lights grey morning
you stumble out of a hole in the ground
a vampire or a victim
it depends on who's around
you used to stay in to watch the adverts
you could lipsynch to the talk shows
and if you look you look through me
and when you talk you talk at me
and when i touch you you don't feel a thing
if i could stay then the night would give you up
stay and the day would keep it's trust
stay and the night would be enough
faraway so close
up with the static and the radio
with satelite television
you can anywhere
miami new orleans london belfast and berlin
and if you listen i can't call
and if you jump you just might fall
and if you shout i'll only hear you
if i could stay then the night would give you up
stay then the day would keep it's trust
stay with the demons you drowned
stay with the spirits i found
stay and the night would be enough
woooooooooo woooooooooo
woooooooooo woooooooooo
o'clock in the morning
it's quiet and there's noone around
just the bang and the clatter
as an angel runs to ground
just the bang and the clatter
as an angel hits the ground
wise men say only fools rush in
but i can't help falling in love with you
wise men say only fools rush in
but i can't help falling in love with you
shall i stay would it be a sin
if i can't help falling in love with you
as the river flows gently to the sea
darling so we go some things were meant to be
take my hand take my whole life too
cause i can't help falling in love with you
as the river flows gently to the sea
darling so we go some things were meant to be
take my hand take my whole heart too
cause i can't help falling in love with you
i can't help falling in love with you
i can't help falling in love with you

when its not always raining there’ll be days like this
when there’s no one complaining there’ll be days like this
when everything falls into place like the flick of a switch
well my mama told me there’ll be days like this
when you dont need to worry there’ll be days like this
when no ones in a hurry there’ll be days like this
when you dont get betrayed by that old judas kiss
oh my mama told me there’ll be days like this
when you don’t need an answer there’ll be days like this
when you don’t meet a chancer there’ll be days like this
when all the parts of the puzzle start to look like they fit
then i must remember there’ll be days like this
there’ll be days like this
when everyone is up front and they’re not playing tricks
when you don’t have no freeloaders out to get their kicks
when its nobody’s business the way that you wanna live
i just have to remember there’ll be days like this
when no one steps on my dreams there’ll be days like this
when people understand what i mean there’ll be days like this
when you ring out the changes of how everything is
well my mama told me there’ll be days like this
na na na na na na na
na na na na na na na

you think you own whatever land you land on
the earth is just a dead thing you can claim
but i know every rock and tree and creature
has a life has a spirit has a name
you think the only people who are people
are the people who look and think like you
but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
you'll learn things you never knew you never knew
have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
can you paint with all the colors of the wind
can you paint with all the colors of the wind
come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
come taste the sun sweet berries of the earth
come roll in all the riches all around you
and for once never wonder what they're worth
the rain storm and the river are my brothers
the heron and the otter are my friends
and we are all connected to each other
in a circle in a hoop that never ends
how high does the sycamore grow
if you cut it down then you'll never know
and you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
for whether we are white or copperskinned
you need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
you need to paint with all the colors of the wind
you can own the earth and still all you own is earth until
you can paint with all the colors of the wind
let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me
let there be peace on earth the peace that was meant to be
with god as our father brothers all are we
let me walk with my brother in perfect harmony
let peace begin with me let this be the moment now
with every step i take let this be my solemn vow
take each moment and live each moment with peace eternally
let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me
take back the holly and mistletoe
silver bells on string
if i wrote a letter to santa claus
i will ask for just one thing
i don't need sleigh rides in the snow
don't want a christmas that's blue
take back the tinsels stockings and bows
cause all i want for christmas is you
i don't need expensive things
they don't matter to me
all that i want it can't be found
underneath the christmas tree
you are the angel atop my tree
you are my dream come true
santa can't bring me what i need
cause all i want for christmas is you
i don't need expensive things
they don't matter to me
all that i want it can't be found
underneath the christmas tree
you are the angel atop my tree
you are my dream come true
santa can't bring me what i need
cause all i want for christmas is you
cause all i want for christmas is you
cause all i want for christmas is you

how to fight loneliness
smile all the time
shine your teeth 'til meaningless
sharpen them with lies
and whatever is going down
will follow you around
that's how you fight loneliness
you laugh at every joke
drag your blanket blindly
fill your heart with smoke
and the first thing that you want
will be the last thing you ever need
that's how you fight it
just smile all the time
just smile all the time
