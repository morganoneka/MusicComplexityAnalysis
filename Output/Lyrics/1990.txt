voleur d'amphores
au fond des criques
j'ai fait la cour des murenes
j'ai fait l'amour
j'ai fait le mort
a la station balneaire
tu t'es pas fait prier
j'étais gant de crin geyser
pour un peu je trempais
histoire d'eau
la nuit je mens
je prends des trains travers la plaine
la nuit je mens
je m'en lave les mains
j'ai dans les bottes des montagnes de questions
ou subsiste encore ton echo
ou subsiste encore ton echo
j'ai fait la saison
dans cette boite cranienne
tes pensees je les faisais miennes
t'accaparer seulement
d'estrade en estrade
j'ai fait danser tant de malentendus
des kilometres de vie en rose
un jour au cirque
un autre chercher te plaire
dresseur de loulous
dynamateur d'acqueducs
la nuit je mens
je prends des trains travers la plaine

vem har tänt den stjärnan som speglas ditt öga
vem tog mörkret bort hedars blick din första natt
vem har flätat kronan av strå omkring din panna
vem har fört tre vise till vårt stall min kära skatt
är du en av tusen små
är du han dom väntar på
du mitt lilla barn en ängel givit namn
är du jordens dolda skatt
jag fått skydda denna natt
är det själva himlen som jag gungar min famn
vem har väckt den rädslan som lät ditt hjärta gråta
varför tar din hand så hårt ett grep om mammas hår
runt oss dansar skuggor nu är ängeln borta
han sa så mycket vackert mycket mer än jag förstår
är du en av tusen små
är du han dom väntar på
du mitt lilla barn en ängel givit namn
är du jordens dolda skatt
jag fått skydda denna natt
är det själva himlen som jag gungar min famn
givatt dina dagar får bli till andras glädje
givat alla möter dig med kärlek mild och god
aldrig ska jag glömma de ord som jag fick höra
vad som än oss hända vill dom ge oss kraft och mod
är du en av tusen små
är du han dom väntar på
du mitt lilla barn en ängel givit namn
är du jordens dolda skatt
jag fått skydda denna natt
är det själva himlen som jag gungar min famn
vem har tänt den stjärnan som speglas ditt öga
himmeldiamanter över staden betlehem

tale old time
true
barely even friends
then somebody bends
unexpectedly
just little change
small say least
both little scared
neither one prepared
beauty beast
ever
ever surprise
ever
ever sure
as sun will rise
tale old time
tune old song
bittersweet strange
finding change
learning wrong
certain sun
rising east
tale old time
song old rhyme
beauty beast
tale old time
song old rhyme
beauty beast
for times stood
for truth made see
for joy brought life
for wrong made right
for every dream made come true

there nights wind cold
that body froze bed
if i listened
right outside window
there days sun cruel
that tears turned dust
and i knew eyes
drying forever
i finished crying instant left
and i remember
and i banished every memory i made
but touch
and hold
i admit
that coming back
when i touch
and i hold
it's hard believe
it's coming back
it's coming back coming back now
there moments gold
and flashes light
there things i'd never
but always seemed right
there nights endless pleasure
it laws allow
baby baby
if i kiss
and whisper
it lost long ago
but coming back
if want
and need
it dead long ago
but coming back
it's hard resist
and coming back
i barely recall
but coming back now
there empty threats hollow lies
and whenever tried hurt
i hurt even worse
and much deeper
there hours went days
when alone last count chances
that lost us forever
but history slamming door
and i made strong somehow
and i never wasted time
but i touch
and kiss
it long ago
but coming back
if touch
and i kiss
it gone wind
but coming back
it's coming back coming back now
there moments gold
and flashes light
there things i'd never
but always seemed right
there nights endless pleasure
it laws allow
baby baby
when touch
and hold
it gone wind
but coming back
when see
and i see
then see want see
all coming back
the flesh fantasies
all coming back
i barely recall
but coming back now
if forgive
if i forgive
we forgive forget
and coming back
when see
and i see
we see want see
all coming back
the flesh fantasies
all coming back
i barely recall coming back now
it's coming back now
and kiss
it's coming back now
and i touch
it's coming back now
if
it's coming back now
and
every night dreams
i see i feel
i know go
far across distance
spaces us

near far

till he appeared soul felt worth
a thrill hope weary world rejoices
for yonder breaks new glorious morn
fall knees
oh hear angel voices
o night divine
oh night christ born

j'ai compris tous les mots j'ai bien compris merci
raisonnable et nouveau c'est ainsi par ici
que les choses ont changé que les fleurs ont fané
que le temps d'avant c'était le temps d'avant
que si tout zappe et lasse les amours aussi passent
il faut que tu saches
j'irai chercher ton coeur si tu l'emportes ailleurs
même si dans tes danses d'autres dansent tes heures
j'irai chercher ton âme dans les froids dans les flammes
je te jetterai des sorts pour que tu m'aimes encore
que tu m'aimes encore
fallait pas commencer m'attirer toucher
fallait pas tant donner moi je sais pas jouer
on dit qu'aujourd'hui dit que les autres font ainsi
je ne suis pas les autres
avant que l'on s'attache avant que l'on se gâche
je veux que tu saches
j'irai chercher ton coeur si tu l'emportes ailleurs
même si dans tes danses d'autres dansent tes heures
j'irai chercher ton ame dans les froids dans les flammes
je te jetterai des sorts pour que tu m'aimes encore
je trouverai des langages pour chanter tes louanges
je ferai nos bagages pour d'infinies vendanges
les formules magiques des marabouts d'afrique
j'les dirai sans remords pour que tu m'aimes encore
je m'inventerai reine pour que tu retiennes
je ferai nouvelle pour que le feu reprenne
je deviendrai ces autres qui te donnent du plaisir
vos jeux seront les nôtres si tel est ton désir
plus brillante plus belle pour une autre étincelle
je changerai en pour que tu m'aimes encore
pour que tu m'aimes encore pour que tu m'aimes encore
tu m'aimes encore pour que tu m'aimes encorefade

who know i'm talking
who's never left home never struck
to find dream life
a place clouds foundation stone
many preceed many will follow
a young girl's dream longer hollow
it takes shape place west
but holds guessed yet
she needs wide open spaces room make big mistakes
she needs new faces she knows high stakes
she traveled road child
wide eyed grinning never tired
but now coming back rest
if life's lessons take test
she needs wide open spaces room make big mistakes
she needs new faces she knows high stakes she knows high stakes
as folks drive away dad yells "check oil"
mom stares window says "i'm leaving girl"
she said "it seem long ago"
when stood let folks know
she needed wide open spaces room make big mistakes
she needs new faces she knows high stakes she knows high stakes

november har vært lagt igjen sludd
se solen går ned svart hvitt
gatene er bare brente broer
i kveld blinker byen som et mareritt
året så langt har vært bare myke pakker
er redd det er seint til å ta det pent
glorien falmet før bladene falt
greinene visket ``jeg fikk som fortjent``
det er ikke alt jeg har sagt som er bull
hadde jeg gods skulle du fått gull
i natt
snøen laver ned
lager vi engler
og vi er himmelen
i natt
snøen laver ned
lager vi engler
og vi er himmelen
alle snille barn er kjøpt og betalt
på skjermen har sjarmen gått tom
gatenes løse fugler er lagt treet
herberget er lagt ned så ingen har rom
jeg trengar noen svar så jeg ringer en svarer
stemmen lyder kjent så lenge det varer
i natt
snøen laver ned
lager vi engler
og vi er himmelen
i natt
snøen laver ned
lager vi engler
og vi er himmelen
face i play

oh
kamukha mo si paraluman
nung tayo ay bata pa
at ang galinggaling mo sumayaw
mapa boogie man o chacha
ngunit ang paborito
ay pagsayaw mo ng el bimbo
nakakaindak nakakaaliw
nakakatindig balahibo
pagkagaling sa skwela ay didiretso na sa inyo
at buong maghapon ay tinuturuan mo ako
magkahawak ang ating kamay
at walang kamalaymalay
na tinuruan mo ang puso ko
na umibig ng tunay
naninigas ang aking katawan
pagumikot na ang plaka
patay sa kembot ng bewang mo
at ang pungay ng iyong mga mata
lumiliwanag ang buhay
habang tayo'y magkaakbay
at dahandahang dumudulas
ang kamay ko sa makinis mong braso
sana noon pa man ay sinabi na sa iyo
kahit hindi na uso ay ito lang ang alam ko
magkahawak ang ating kamay
at walang kamalaymalay
na tinuruan mo ang puso ko
na umibig ng tunay
la la la la
la la
la la
la la la la
lumipas ang maraming taon
di na tayo nagkita
balita ko'y may anak ka na
ngunit walang asawa
tagahugas ka raw ng pinggan
sa may ermita
at isang gabi nasagasaan
sa isang madilim na eskinita
lahat ng pangarap ko'y bigla lang natunaw
sa panaginip na lang pala kita maisasayaw
magkahawak ang ating kamay
at walang kamalaymalay
na tinuruan mo ang puso ko
na umibig ng tunay
magkahawak ang ating kamay
at walang kamalaymalay
na tinuruan mo ang puso ko
na umibig ng tunay

tinawanan pa kita tinawag mo 'kong walanghiya
eh medyo pangit ka pa no'n
ngunit ngayon

iba na ang yong tingin
nagbago nang lahat sa 'yo
sana'y hindi nakita
sana'y walang problema
pagkat kulang ang dala kong pera
na pambili ooh
pambili sa mukha mong maganda
siguro ay may kotse ka na ngayon
rumarampa sa entablado
damit mo'y gawa ni sotto
siguro'y malapit ka na ring sumali
sa supermodel whole wide universe

iba na ang yong tingin
nagbago nang lahat sa 'yo
sana'y hindi nakita

pagkat kulang ang dala kong pera

pare ko meron akong prublema
'wag mo sabihing "na naman"
inlab ako sa isang kolehiyala
hindi ko maintindihan
wag na nating idaan sa "maboteng" usapan
lalu lang madaragdagan ang sakit ng ulo bilbil sa tiyan
anong sarap kami'y naging magkaibigan
napuno ako ng pagasa
yun pala hanggang dun lang ang kaya
akala ko ay puwede pa
masakit mang isipin kailangang tanggapin
kung kelan ka naging siryoso saka ka niya gagaguhin
o diyos ko ano ba naman ito
di ba 'tangina nagmukha akong tanga
pinaasa niya lang ako
letseng pagibig 'to
diyos ko ano ba naman ito woh
sabi niya ayaw niya munang magkasyota
dehins ako naniwala
di nagtagal naging ganun na rin ang tema
kulang na lang ay sagot niya
ba't ba ang labo niya di ko maipinta
hanggang kelan maghihintay ako ay nabuburat na
pero minamahal ko siya
di biro tl ako sa kanya
alam kong nababaduyan ka na sa mga sinasabi ko
pero sana naman ay maintindihan mo
o pare ko o pare ko meron ka bang maipapayo
kung wala ay okey lang kung wala ay okey lang
kailangan lang ay kailangan lang ang iyong pakikiramay
nandito ka ay ayos na nandito ka ay ayos na
masakit mang isipin kailangang tanggapin
kung kelan ka naging seryoso saka ka niya gagaguhin
o diyos ko ano ba naman ito
di ba 'tangina nagmukha akong tanga
pinaasa niya lang ako
letseng pagibig 'to
diyos ko ano ba naman ito woh
o diyos ko ano ba naman ito
di ba 'tangina nagmukha akong tanga
pinaasa niya lang ako
letseng pagibig 'to
diyos ko ano ba naman ito woh

among fields barley
you tell sun jealous sky
when walked fields gold
so took love
for gaze awhile
among fields barley
in arms fell hair came
among fields gold
will stay

among fields barley
and tell sun jealous sky
when walked fields gold
i never made promises lightly
and i broken
but i swear days still left
we will walk fields gold
we will walk fields gold
i never made promises lightly
and i broken
but i swear days still left
we will walk fields gold
we will walk fields gold
ooo ooo ooo
many years passed summer days
among fields barley
see children run sun goes
as lie fields gold
you'll remember west wind moves
among fields barley
you tell sun jealous sky
when walked fields gold
when walked fields gold
when walked fields gold
somewhere rainbow way high
in land i heard lullaby
somewhere rainbow skies blue
and dreams dare dream really come true
someday i'll wish upon star
wake clouds far behind
where troubles melt lemon drops
away chimney tops find
somewhere rainbow skies blue
and dreams dare dream really come true
if happy little bluebirds fly
rainbow oh i

i'm wasting my time i got nothing to do
i'm hanging around i'm waiting for you
but nothing ever happens and i wonder

i'm driving too fast i'm driving too far
i'd like to change my point of view
i feel so lonely i'm waiting for you
but nothing ever happens and i wonder
i wonder how i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemontree
i'm turning my head up and down
i'm turning turning turning turning turning around
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemontree
dadada
i'm sitting here i miss the power
i'd like to go out taking a shower
but there's a heavy cloud inside my head
i feel so tired put myself into bed
where nothing ever happens and i wonder
isolation is not good for me
isolation i don't want to sit on a lemontree
i'm steppin' around in a desert of joy
baby anyhow i'll get another toy
and everything will happen and you'll wonder
i wonder how i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemontree
i'm turning my head up and down
i'm turning turning turning turning turning around
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemontree
and i wonder i wonder
i wonder how i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see
and all that i can see

depuis le temps que je patiente
dans cette chambre noire
j'entends qu'on s'amuse et qu'on chante
au bout du couloir
quelqu'un touché le verrou
et j'ai plongé vers le grand jour
j'ai vu les fanfares les barrières
et les gens autour
dans les premiers moments j'ai cru
qu'il fallait seulement se défendre
mais cette place est sans issue
je commence à comprendre
ils ont refermé derrière moi
ils ont eu peur que je recule
je vais bien finir par l'avoir
cette danseuse ridicule
estce que ce monde est sérieux
estce que ce monde est sérieux
andalousie je souviens
les prairies bordées de cactus
je ne vais pas trembler devant
ce pantin ce minus
je vais l'attraper lui et son chapeau
les faire tourner comme un soleil
ce soir la femme du torero
dormira sur ses deux oreilles
estce que ce monde est sérieux
estce que ce monde est sérieux
j'en ai poursuivi des fantômes
presque touché leurs ballerines
ils ont frappé fort dans mon cou
pour que je m'incline
ils sortent d'où ces acrobates
avec leurs costumes de papier
j'ai jamais appris à battre
contre des poupées
sentir le sable sous ma tête
c'est fou comme ça peut faire du bien
j'ai prié pour que tout s'arrête
andalousie je souviens
je les entends rire comme je râle
je les vois danser comme je succombe
je pensais pas qu'on puisse autant
s'amuser autour d'une tombe
estce que ce monde est sérieux
estce que ce monde est sérieux
si si hombre hombre baila baila
hay que bailar de nuevo
y mataremos otros
otras vidas otros toros
y mataremos otros
venga venga bailar
y mataremos otros
le le le oh oh oh
out barely see breath
surrounded jealousy death
i reached one call
dragged underneath separate
you
this time lost return
in spite everything i've learned
i hid tracks spit air
slipped cracks stripped cares
my cares
e||
i'm tired sheep counting
no struggle energy
no patient write
it's crazy i'm sticking round
strumming pain fingers singing life words
killing softly song killing softly song
telling whole life words
killing softly song
i heard sang good song
i heard style
and i came see
listen
and young boy
stranger eyes
strumming pain fingers singing life words
killing softly song killing softly song
telling whole life words
killing softly song
i felt flushed fever
embarrassed crowd
i felt found letters
read one loud
i prayed finish
kept right
strumming pain fingers singing life words
killing softly song killing softly song
telling whole life words
killing softly song
strumming pain fingers singing life words
killing softly song killing softly song
telling whole life words
killing softly song


blame roots
i showed boots
and ruined black tie affair

o little town bethlehem
how still see thee lie
above thy deep dreamless sleep
the silent stars go
yet thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes fears years
are met thee tonight
oh holy child bethlehem
descend us pray
cast sins enter
be born us today
oh morning stars together
proclaim holy birth
and praises sing god king
and peace men earth
you know dream river changing flows
and dreamer's vessel must follow goes
trying learn behind
and never knowing store
makes day constant battle
just stay shores
and i will sail vessel 'til river runs dry
like bird upon wind waters sky
i'll never reach destination i never try
so i will sail vessel 'til river runs dry
too many times stand aside let waters slip away
'til put 'til tomorrow now become today
so sit upon shoreline say satisfied
choose chance rapids dare dance tide
and i will sail vessel 'til river runs dry
like bird upon wind waters sky
i'll never reach destination i never try
so i will sail vessel 'til river runs dry
and bound rough waters
and i know i'll take falls
but good lord captain
i make
and i will sail vessel 'til river runs dry
like bird upon wind waters sky
i'll never reach destination i never try
so i will sail vessel 'til river runs dry
yes i will sail vessel
'til river runs dry
'til river runs dry
threethirty morning soul sight
the city's lookin' ghost town moonless summer night
raindrops windshield storm moving
he's headin' back somewhere never
and thunder rolls thunder rolls
every light burnin' house across town
she's pacin' telephone faded flannel gown
askin' miracle hopin' right
prayin' weather kept night
and thunder rolls thunder rolls
and thunder rolls lightnin' strikes
another love grows cold sleepless night
as storm blows control
deep heart thunder rolls
she's waitin' window pulls drive
she rushes hold thankful alive
but wind rain strange new perfume blows
and lightnin' flashes eyes knows knows
and thunder rolls thunder rolls
and thunder rolls lightnin' strikes
another love grows cold sleepless night
as storm blows control
deep heart thunder rolls
she runs back hallway bedroom door
she reaches pistol kept dresser drawer
tells lady mirror he
cause tonight will last time wonder
and thunder rolls thunder rolls
and thunder rolls lightnin' strikes
another love grows cold sleepless night
as storm blows control
deep heart thunder rolls

but heal broken heart
wouldn't time charm
sometimes i need time
sometimes i need time alone
everybody needs time
don't know need time alone
and fears subside
and shadows still remain oh yeah
i know love
when one left blame
so never mind darkness
we still find way
cause nothin' lasts forever
even cold november rain
don't think need somebody
don't think need someone
everybody needs somebody you're one you're one
je vraagt ik zin heb een sigaret
het twee uur 's nachts liggen op bed
in een hotel een stad waar niemand ons hoort
waar niemand ons kent en niemand ons stoort
op de vloer ligt een lege fles wijn
en kledingstukken die van jou mij kunnen zijn
een schemering de radio zacht
en deze nacht heeft alles wat ik van een nacht verwacht
het een nacht die je normaal alleen films ziet
het een nacht die wordt bezongen het mooiste lied
het een nacht waarvan ik dacht dat ik hem nooit beleven zou
maar vannacht beleef ik hem met jou
oh oh oh oh oh
ik ben nog wakker en ik staar naar het plafond
en ik denk aan hoe de dag lang geleden begon
het zomaar ervandoor gaan met jou
niet wetend waar de reis eindigen zou
nu lig ik hier een wild vreemde stad
en heb net de nacht van mijn leven gehad
maar helaas er komt weer licht door de ramen
hoewel voor ons de wereld vannacht heeft stil gestaan
het een nacht die je normaal alleen films ziet
het een nacht die wordt bezongen het mooiste lied
het een nacht waarvan ik dacht dat ik hem nooit beleven zou
maar vannacht beleef ik hem met jou
oh oh oh oh oh
maar een lied blijft slechts bij woorden
een film scène gezet
maar deze nacht met jou
levensecht
het een nacht die je normaal alleen films ziet
het een nacht die wordt bezongen het mooiste lied
het een nacht waarvan ik dacht dat ik hem nooit beleven zou
maar vannacht beleef ik hem met jou
oh oh oh oh oh
ja vannacht beleef ik hem met jou
oh oh oh oh oh
en ik hou alleen nog maar van jou
oh oh oh oh

im wagen vor mir fährt ein junges mädchen
sie fährt allein und sie scheint hübsch zu sein
ich weiss nicht ihren namen und ich kenne nicht ihr ziel
ich merke nur sie fährt mit viel gefühl
im wagen vor mir fährt ein junges mädchen
ich möcht gern wissen sie grade denkt
hört sie den selben sender oder ist ihr radio aus
fährt sie zum rendezvous oder nach haus
ratta rada radadadada ratta rada radadadada
was will der blöde kerl da hinter mir nur
ich frag mich warum überholt der nicht
der hängt nun schon ne halbe stunde ständig hinter mir
nun dämmerts schon und der fährt ohne licht
der könnt schon hundert kilometer weg sein
mensch fahr meiner ente doch vorbei
will der mich kontrollieren oder will er mich entführen
oder ist das zivil die polizei
ratta rada radadadada ratta rada radadadada
wie schön dass ich heut endlich einmal zeit hab
ich muss nicht rasen wie ein wilder stier
ich träum gedanken ganz allein und ohne schranken
und wünscht das schöne mädchen wär bei mir
nun wird mir diese sache langsam mulmig
ich fahr die allernächste abfahrt raus
dort werd ich mich verstecken hinter irgendwelchen hecken
verdammt dadurch komm ich zu sät nach haus
bye bye mein schönes mädchen gute reise
sie hat den blinker hier fährt sie ab
für mich wird zwei stunden auch die fahrt zuende gehn
doch dich mein mädchen werd ich nie mehr sehn

ya estás más mi lado corazón
en el alma sólo tengo soledad
y si ya puedo verte
porque dios lo hizo quererte
para hacerme sufrir más
siempre fuiste la razón de mi existir
adorarte para mí fue religión
en tus besos yo encontraba
el calor que brindaba
el amor de tu pasión
es la historia de un amor
como hay otro igual
que hizo comprender
que le dio luz mi vida
apagándola después
ayque noche tan obscura
sin tu amor viviré
siempre fuiste la razón de mi existir
adorarte para mí fue religión
en tus besos yo encontraba
el calor que brindaba
el amor de tu pasión
es la historia de un amor
como hay otro igual
que hizo comprender
que le dio luz mi vida
apagándola después
ayque noche tan obscura
sin tu amor viviré

many nights prayed proof anyone hear
in hearts hopeful song barely understood
now afraid although know much fear
we moving mountains long knew
there miracles believe
though hope frail hard kill
who knows miracles achieve
when believe
somehow will will believe
in time fear prayer often proves vain
hope seemed summer birds swiftly flown away
yet now i'm standing heart's full i explain
seeking faith speaking words i never thought i'd say
there miracles believe
though hope frail hard kill
who knows miracles achieve
when believe
somehow will will believe
they don’t always happen ask
and it’s easy give fear
but you’re blinded pain
can’t see way safe rain
thought still resilient voice
says love near
there miracles believe
though hope frail hard kill
who knows miracles achieve
when believe
somehow will now will
you will believe
you will believe
no i forget evening
or face leaving
but i guess way story goes
you always smile eyes sorrow shows
yes shows
no i forget tomorrow
when i think sorrow
when i i let go
and now fair i let know
what know
i live
if living without
i live
i give anymore
i live
if living without
i give

well i forget evening
or face leaving
but i guess way story goes
you always smile eyes sorrow show
yes shows

the chrome steel rides collidin' air breathes
the air breathes
you know ain't easy got hold

now dressin' two kids lookin' magic kiss
somewhere desert highway rides harley davidson
her long blonde hair flyin' wind she's runnin' half life
the chrome steel rides collidin' air breathes

two onetwothreefour
the girl i've loved
was born roses eyes
but buried alive
one evening nineteenfortyfive
with sister side
and weeks guns
all came rained everyone
now little boy spain
playing pianos filled flames
on empty rings around sun
all sing say dream come
but now must pick every piece
of life used love
just keep
at least enough carry
and now ride circus wheel
with dark brother wrapped white
says good alive
but now rides comet's flame
and coming back
the earth looks better star
that's right
he mean make cry
with sparks ring bullets fly
on empty rings around heart
the world screams falls apart
but now must pick every piece
of life used love
just keep
at least enough carry
and mother sleeps
and room brothers born
indentions sheets
where bodies moved move anymore
and sad see world agree
that rather see faces filled flies
all i'd want keep white roses eyes
what beautiful face
i found place
circling around sun
what beautiful dream
flash screen
blink eye gone
soft sweet
let hold close keep
one day will die
ashes will fly aeroplane sea
now young
let us lay sun
count every beautiful thing see
love
arms i'm keepin
curious life found tonight
music sounds street
lights cloud
anna's ghost around
hear voice rolling ringing
soft sweet
how notes bend reach trees
now i remember
i push fingers
mouth make muscles move
make voice smooth sweet
and now keep know
all secrets sleep winter clothes
one loved long ago
what beautiful face
i found place
circling around sun
and meet cloud
i'll laughing loud
i'll laughing everyone i see
can't believe
strange anything
oh comely
i will lose breath
chasing meaningful memory thought left
with pretty bright bubbly terrible scene
that thing chest
but oh comely
it pretty guess
it mean anything
oh comely
all friends letting blow
bristling ugly
bursting fruits falling holes
of pretty bright bubbly friend
you need say comforting things ear
but oh comely
there one friend find
i'll crush everything i
say want say
hang hollow ways moving mouth
pull miracles aimed
your father made fetuses
while mother
were asleep trailer park
thunderous sparks dark stadiums
the music medicine needed comforting
so make fat fleshy fingers moving
and pluck silly strings
and bend notes
soft silly music meaningful magical
the movements beautiful
all ovaries
all milking green fleshy flowers
while powerful pistons sugary sweet machines
smelling semen garden
was needing still believed
say wanna say hang hollow ways
moving mouth pull miracles aimed

her lips colour roses
that grew river all bloody wild
when knocked door and entered room
my trembling subsided sure embrace

he wiped tears that ran face
they call wild rose but name eliza day
why call i know for name eliza day
on second day i brought flower
she beautiful than woman i'd seen
i said know where wild roses grow
so sweet scarlet free
on second day came with single red rose
he said give loss sorrow
i nodded head as i lay bed
if i show roses will follow
they call wild rose but name eliza day
why call i know for name eliza day
on third day took river
he showed roses and kissed
and last thing i heard was muttered word
as knelt rock fist
on last day i took where wild roses grow
as lay bank the wind light thief
and i kissed goodbye said beauty must die
and i leant planted rose 'tween teeth
they call wild rose but name eliza day
why call i know for name eliza day
my name eliza day for name eliza day

langya talaga wala ka bang ibang alam
namumugtong mga mata
kailan pa ba kaya ikaw magsasawa
sa problema na iyong pinapasan
hatid sayo ng boyfriend mong hindi mo maintindihan
may kwento kang pandrama na naman
ang pagtiyaga mo dyan sa boyfriend mong tanga
na wala nang ginagawa kundi ang paluhain ka
sa libulibong pagkakataon na tayoy nagkasama
iilang ulit palang kitang nakitang masaya
naiinis akong isipin na ginaganyan ka ya
siguro ay hindi niya lang alam ang iyong
tunay na halaga
hindi na dapat pagusapan pa
nagpapagod na rin ako sa aking kakasalita
hindi ka rin naman nakikinig
kahit sobrang pagod na ang aking bibig
sa mga payo kong di mo pinapansin
akala mo'y nakikinig di rin naman tatanggapin
ayoko nang isipin pa
di ko alam ba't di mo makayanan na iwanan sya
ang damidami naman diyang iba
wag kang mangangambang baka wala ka nang ibang makita
na lalake na magmahal sayo
at hinding hindi nya sasayangin ang pagibig mo
sa libulibong pagkakataon na tayoy nagkasama
iilang ulit palang kitang nakitang masaya
naiinis akong isipin na ginaganyan ka ya
siguro ay hindi niya lang alam ang iyong
tunay na halaga
sa libolibong pagka
minsan hindi ko maintindihan
sa libulibong pagkakataon na tayoy nagkasama
iilang ulit palang kitang nakitang masaya
naiinis akong isipin na ginaganyan ka ya
siguro ay hindi niya lang alam ang iyong
tunay na halaga
sa libolibong pagka
uso pa ba ang harana marahil ikaw ay nag tataka
sino ba tong mukang gago nag kandarapa
sa pagkanta nasisintunado sa kaba
meron pang dalang mga rosas suot namay
maong na kupas
nariyan pa ang barkada naka porma't naka barong
sa awiting daig pa ang minus one sing along
puno ang langit ng bitwin kay lamig pa ng hangin
sa iyong tingin akoy nababaliw giliw
sa awitin kong ito sanay maibigan mo
ibubuhos ko ang buong puso ko sa isang
munting harana para sa iyo
hindi bat parang isang sine isang pelikulang romantiko
hindi bat ikaw ang bidang artista
ako ang iyong leading man
sa istoryang nagwawakas sa pag ibig na wagas
puno ang langit ng bitwin kay lamig pa ng hangin
sa iyong tingin akoy nababaliw giliw
sa awitin kong ito sanay maibigan mo
ibubuhos ko ang buong puso ko sa isang
munting harana para sa iyo

your messedup world will thrill
alison i'm lost

outside room sister's spinning
but lies tells fine

and sailors strike poses
tv covered walls slowly
with talking pills

alison i'm lost
alison i'll drink wine
i wear clothes high
alison i said sinking
but laugh tells fine
i guess somewhere
somebody told world gonna roll
i ain't sharpest tool shed
she looking kinda dumb finger
thumb shape "l" forehead
well years start coming stop coming
fed rules i hit ground running

your brain gets smart head gets dumb
so much much see
so wrong taking back streets
you'll never know go
you'll never shine glow
hey now all star game go play
hey now rock star show paid
and glitters gold
only shooting stars break mold
it's cool place say gets colder
you're bundled now wait 'til older
but meteor men beg differ
judging hole satellite picture
the ice skate getting pretty thin
the waters getting warm might well swim
my world's fire
that's way i i never bored
hey now all star game go play
hey now rock star show paid
glitters gold
only shooting stars break mold
hey now all star game go play

so tired i even sleep
so many secrets i keep
promised i weep
one promise i keep
it seems one help now
i'm deep way
this time i really led astray
runaway train never going back
wrong way oneway track
seems i getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither
can help remember smile
make somehow seem worthwhile
how earth i jaded
life's mysteries seem faded
i go one go
i know one knows
here i drowning rain
with ticket runaway train
and everything seems cut dry
day night earth sky
somehow i believe
runaway train never going back
wrong way oneway track
seems i getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither
bought ticket runaway train
like madman laughing rain
little touch little insane
it's easier dealing pain
runaway train never going back
wrong way oneway track
seems i getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither
runaway train never coming back
runaway train tearing track
runaway train burning veins
i'd runaway always seems
repeat fade
in eyes indisposed
in disguises one knows
hides face lies snake
the sun disgrace
boiling heat summer stench
neath black sky looks dead
call name cream
and i'll hear scream
black hole sun
won't come
and wash away rain
black hole sun
won't come come come
stuttering cold damp
steal warm wind tired friend
times gone honest men
and sometimes far long snakes
in shoes walking sleep
and youth i pray keep
heaven sent hell away
no one sings anymore
black hole sun
won't come
and wash away rain
black hole sun
won't come come
black hole sun
won't come
and wash away rain
black hole sun
won't come
won't come black hole sun black hole sun

many soldier shed lifeblood blade

i went aloft furled mainsail blow
and yards broke said i got killed

i slipped fell wet concrete
they buried gray tomb knows sound
but i still around

i'll fly starship 'cross universe divide
and i reach side
i'll find place rest spirit i
perhaps i may become highwayman
or i may simply single drop rain
but i will remain
and i'll back

reveal one star time
drove back town morning working mind
i thought maybe quitting
thought leaving behind
went back bed morning
and i'm pulling blind
the sky dull hypothetical
and falling one cloud time
that night toronto checkerboard floors
riding horseback keeping order restored
til men hang
stepped mic sang
and voices rang aryan twang
i got house morning little nine
in middle riot
couldn't mind
so i'm house morning
just little nine
cause bobcaygeon i saw constellations
reveal one star time
sundown paris prairies
wheat kings treasures buried
and hear rusty breezes
pushing around weathervane jesus
in zippo lighter sees killer's face
maybe someone standing killers place
twenty years nothing well nothing new besides
no one's interested something
wheat kings pretty things
let's see morning brings
there's dream dreams high school dead stark
it's museum locked dark
where walls lined yellow grey sinister
hung pictures parents' prime ministers
wheat kings pretty things
wait see tomorrow brings
late breaking story cbc
a nation whispers "we always knew go free"
they add "you fond living past
cause way gonna last"
wheat kings pretty things
let's see tomorrow brings
wheat kings pretty things
ah tomorrow brings

and his promise true faith undo
the many chances i blew bring life anew
clear blue unconditional skies dried tears eyes lonely cries
my bleedin' hope folk cope
with endurin' pain keeps 'em pourin' rain
who's blame tootin' 'caine vein
what shame shoot aim someone else's brain
you claim insane name day time fallin' prey

dreams hopeless aspirations
in hopes comin' true believe rest

the earth dead thing claim
but i know every rock tree creature
life spirit name
you think people people
people look think
but walk footsteps stranger
learn things never knew never knew

come run hidden pine trails forest
come taste sun sweet berries earth
come roll riches around
never wonder worth
the rain storm river brothers
the heron otter friends
and connected
circle hoop never ends
how high sycamore grow
if cut never know
and never hear wolf cry blue corn moon
for whether white copperskinned
you need sing voices mountain
you need paint colors wind
you earth still earth
paint colors wind
let peace earth let begin

with god father brothers
let walk brother perfect harmony
let peace begin let moment now
with every step i take let solemn vow
take moment live moment peace eternally
let peace earth let begin

shine teeth 'til meaningless
sharpen lies

that's fight loneliness
you laugh every joke
drag blanket blindly
fill heart smoke
and first thing want
will last thing need
that's fight
just smile time
