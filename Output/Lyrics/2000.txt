san francisco’s calling us giants mets will play
piazza new york catcher straight gay
we hung stadium we’ve got place stay
we hung tenderloin tenderly tell
about saddest book read always makes cry
the statue’s crying well may
i love i’ve drowning grip adoring face
i love responsibility found place
beside strong warnings guise gentle words
come wave upon family wider net absurd
“you’ll take care i know will better job”
maybe deserves
elope miss private we’ll drink awake
we’ll taste coffee houses award certificates
a privy seal keep feel style
we’ll comment decor we’ll help passer
and dusk work we’ll continue debate
in borrowed bedroom virginal spare
the catcher hits catches every day
the pitcher puts religion first rests holidays
he goes cathedrals lies prostrate floor
he knows drink affects speed he’s praying
back life wants confession bench
life outside diamond wrench
i wish pass dull weekend
i know wouldn’t come love heroine pretend
a lady stepping songs love day
you’d settle epitaph “walk away renee”
the sun upon roof winter will draw
meet statue hour

she put burnin' end midnight cigarette
she broke heart spent whole life tryin' forget
we watched drink pain away little time
but never drunk enough mind
until night
he put bottle head pulled trigger
and finally drank away memory
life short time bigger
than strength knees
we found face pillow
with note said i'll love till i die
and buried beneath willow
the angels sang whiskey lullaby
la la la la la la la lalalalala
la la la la la la la lalalalala
the rumors flew nobody knew much blamed
for years years tried hide whiskey breath
she finally drank pain away little time
but never drunk enough mind
until night
she put bottle head pulled trigger
and finally drank away memory
life short time bigger
than strength knees
we found face pillow
clinging picture dear life
we laid next beneath willow
while angels sang whiskey lullaby
la la la la la la la lalalalala gradually grow softer
la la la la la la la lalalalala
la la la la la la la lalalalala
all lines across face tell story i
so many stories i've i got i
but stories mean anything got one tell

i walking street
when corner eye
i saw pretty little thing approaching
she said "i've never seen man
who looks alone
could use little company
if pay right price

and go send way"
i said "you're sweet young thing
why yourself"
she looked said
"oh ain't rest wicked

i got mouths feed
there ain't nothing world free
i know i slow
i hold back
though know i wish i
no ain't rest wicked
until close eyes good"
not even fifteen minutes later
i'm still walking street
when i saw shadow man creep sight
then walks behind
and puts gun head
he made clear looking fight
he said "give got
i want money life
but try make move i think twice"
i said "you cash
but first know i got ask
what made want live kind life"
he said "there ain't rest wicked
money grow trees
i got bills pay
i got mouths feed
there ain't nothing world free
i know i slow
i hold back
though know i wish i
no ain't rest wicked
until close eyes good"
now couple hours passed
and i sitting house
the day winding coming end
so i turned tv
and flipped news
and i saw i almost comprehend
i saw preacher man cuffs taken money church
he's got bank account righteous dollar bills
but even still i say much
because i know
oh yes seek satisfy thrills
"oh ain't rest wicked
money grow trees
i got bills pay
i got mouths feed
there ain't nothing world free
oh slow
we hold back
though know wish
no ain't rest wicked
until close eyes good"


wala na ang dating pagtingin
sawa na ba sa'king lambing
wala ka namang dahilan
bakit bigla nalang nangiwan
hindi na alam ang gagawin
upang ika’y magbalik sakin
ginawa ko naman ang lahat
bakit bigla nalang naghanap
hindi magbabago
pagmamahal sa iyo
sana’y pakinggan mo
ang awit ng pusong ito
tulad ng mundong hindi
tumitigil sa pagikot
pagibig di mapapagod
tulad ng ilog na hindi
tumitigil sa pag agos
pag ibig di matatapos
alaala’y bumabalik
mga panahong nasasabik
sukdulang mukha ay
laging nasa panaginip
bakit biglang pinagpalit
pagsasamaha'y tila nawaglit
ang dating walang hanggan
nagkaroon ng katapusan
hindi magbabago
pagmamahal sa iyo
sana’y pakinggan mo
ang awit ng pusong ito
tulad ng mundong hindi
tumitigil sa pagikot
pagibig di mapapagod
tulad ng ilog na hindi
tumitigil sa pag agos
pag ibig di matatapos
tulad ng mundong hindi
tumitigil sa pagikot
pagibig di mapapagod
tulad ng ilog na hindi
tumitigil sa pag agos
pag ibig 'di matatapos
tumitigilpagibig 'di matatapos

ein hotdog unten hafen
vorm einschlafen schnell noch ein bier
dem feind einen tritt die rippen
und ein paar kippen für hinterher
ein date mit dem dalai lama
und ein apfelsaft morgens um zwei
und eine halbautomatische waffe ist immer dabei
schön wenn man liebt
was mutter natur einem gibt
was kann ich dafür dass du mich nicht vergisst
ein geselliges tier ist das schwein
und das stachelschwein lieber allein
ohne dich will ich nicht
mit dir kann ich nicht sein
räucherstäbchen und wildreis
und abende auf dem balkon
in eppendorf ist morgen flohmarkt
und jeder nach seiner facon
ein date mit dem dalai lama
und ein griff ins kosmetikregal
und wenn's im rücken mal weh tut wird jede bewegung zur qual
schön wenn man liebt
was mutter natur einem gibt
was kann ich dafür dass du mich nicht vergisst
ein geselliges tier ist das schwein
und das stachelschwein lieber allein
ohne dich will ich nicht
mit dir kann ich nicht sein
eine parkbank planten und blomen
und der mond über altona
ein sohn der bald mal ins bett muss
und trockene blumen im haar
ein date mit dem dalai lama
und ein klimpern auf dem klavier
und zum abschied ein bisschen gefummel hinter der tür
schön wenn man liebt
was mutter natur einem gibt
was kann ich dafür dass du mich nicht vergisst
ein geselliges tier ist das schwein
und das stachelschwein lieber allein
ohne dich will ich nicht
mit dir kann ich nicht sein
ohne dich will ich nicht
mit dir kann ich nicht sein
haven't laughed hard long time
i better stop now i start crying
go sleep sunshine
i wanna see day dying
she's sight see sight see
she's good good
but i'm already somebody's baby
she's pretty thing pretty thing
and knows everything everything
but i'm already somebody's baby
you deserve lonely
but drugs got make feel better
pretty soon find
little part life keeping together
i'm nice nice
i make make
but already somebody's baby
i make smile make smile
if stayed stayed
but long will stay baby
because candle burns bright
well i almost forgot twilight
even i think right
well i'm tired i got fight
you're wonderful wonderful
when beautiful beautiful
but i'm already somebody's baby
and i went went
i'd disapoint disappoint
but i'm already somebody's baby
already somebody's baby

i wake before i come undone
save save nothing i've become

frozen inside without touch
without love darling
only life among dead

suppressed childish fears
leave i wish leave
'cause presence still lingers leave alone
these wounds seem heal
this pain real
there's much time erase
when cried i'd wipe away tears
when scream i'd fight away fears
i held hand years
but still

you used captivate resonating light
now i'm bound life left behind
your face haunts pleasant dreams
voice chased away sanity
these wounds seem heal
this pain real
there's much time erase
when cried i'd wipe away tears
when scream i'd fight away fears
i held hand years
but still
i've tried hard tell gone
though still i've alone along
when cried i'd wipe away tears
when scream i'd fight away fears
i held hand years
but still

am i bargained yet
i've dying tell anything
you want hear cause i week

na janay kab say umeedein kuch baqi hain
mujhe phir bhi teri yaadkyun aati hai na janay kab say
duur jitna bhi tum mujh say pass teray mein
ab aadat si hai mujh ko aisay jeenay mein
zindagi say koi shiqwa hi nahi hai
ab zinda hoon mein neelay aasman mein
chaahat aisi hai yeh teri barhti jaye
aahat aise hai yeh teri mujhko sataye
yaadain gehri hain yeh kitni dil doob jaye
aur aankhon main yeh ghum num ban jaye
ab tau addat si hai mujhko aise jeene main
sabhi yadein hain sabhi batein hain
bhula unhein mita uhein

there's man goin' 'round takin' names
and decides free blame
everybody treated
there'll golden ladder reaching
when man comes around
the hairs arm will stand
at terror sip sup
will partake last offered cup
or disappear potter's ground
when man comes around
hear trumpets hear pipers
one hundred million angels singin'
multitudes marchin' big kettledrum
voices callin' voices cryin'
some born dyin'
it's alpha omega kingdom come
and whirlwind thorn trees
and virgins trimming wicks
the whirlwind thorn trees
it's hard thee kick pricks
till armageddon shalom shalom
then father hen will call chicken's home
the wise man will bow throne
and feet will cast golden crowns…
when man comes around
whoever unjust let unjust still
whoever righteous let righteous still
whoever filthy let filthy still
listen words long written
when man comes around
hear trumpets hear pipers
one hundred million angels singing
multitudes marchin' big kettledrum
voices callin' voices cryin'
some born dyin'
it's alpha omega kingdom come
and whirlwind thorn trees
and virgins trimming wicks
the whirlwind thorn trees
it's hard thee kick pricks
in measured hundred weight penny pound
when man comes around

tengo la camisa negra
hoy mi amor está de luto
hoy tengo en el alma una pena
y es por culpa de tu embrujo
hoy sé que tu ya quieres
y eso es lo que mas hiere
que tengo la camisa negra
y una pena que duele
mal parece que solo quede
y fue pura todita tu mentira
que aquel dia te encontré
por beber del veneno
malevolo de tu amor
yo quede moribundo
y lleno de dolor
respiré de ese humo
amargo de tu adios
y desde que tu te fuiste yo solo
tengo tengo la camisa negra
porque negra tengo el alma
yo por ti perdí la calma
y casi pierdo hasta mi cama
cama c'mon c'mon baby
te digo con disimulo
que tengo la camisa negra
y debajo tengo el difunto pa' enterrartelo cuando quieras mamita
tengo la camisa negra
ya tu amor interesa
lo que ayer supo gloria
hoy sabe pura
miercoles por la tarde
y tu que llegas
nisiquiera muestras señas
y yo con la camisa negra
y tus maletas en la puerta
mal parece que solo quede
y fue pura todita tu mentira
que aquel dia te encontré
por beber del veneno
malevolo de tu amor
yo quede moribundo
y lleno de dolor
respiré de ese humo
amargo de tu adios
y desde que tu te fuiste yo solo
tengo tengo la camisa negra
porque negra tengo el alma
yo por ti perdí la calma
y casi pierdo hasta mi cama
cama c'mon c'mon baby
te digo con disimulo

crawling skin
these wounds will heal
fear i fall
confusing real
there's something inside pulls beneath surface
consuming confusing
this lack self control i fear never ending
controlling
i seem
to find
my walls closing
i've felt way
so insecure
crawling skin
these wounds will heal
fear i fall
confusing real
discomfort endlessly pulled upon
distracting reacting
against will i stand beside reflection
it's haunting i seem
to find
my walls closing
i've felt way
so insecure
crawling skin
these wounds will heal
fear i fall
confusing real
it starts one thing i know
it even matter hard try
keep mind i designed rhyme
to explain due time
all i know time valuable thing
watch fly pendulum swings
watch count end day
the clock ticks life away
it's unreal didn't look
watch time go right window
trying hold even know
wasted
watch go i kept everything inside
and even though i tried fell apart
what meant will eventually
be memory time
i tried hard and got far but end it even matter
i fall to lose but end it even matter
one thing i know
it even matter hard try
keep mind i designed rhyme
to remind
i tried hard in spite way mocking
acting i part property
remembering times fought
i'm surprised got far
things way
you even recognize anymore
not knew back
but comes back
in end
and even though i tried fell apart
what meant will eventually
be memory time
i tried hard and got far but end it even matter
i fall to lose but end it even matter
i put trust pushed far i go
and there's one thing know
i put trust pushed far i go
and there's one thing know
i tried hard and got far but end it even matter
i fall to lose but end it even matter

in farewell
there’s blood
there’s alibi
‘cause i’ve drawn regret
from truth
of thousand lies
so let mercy come
and wash away
what i’ve done
i'll face
to cross i’ve become
erase
and let go i’ve done
put rest
what thought
while i clean slate
with hands
of uncertainty
so let mercy come
and wash away
what i’ve done
i'll face
to cross i’ve become
erase
and let go i’ve done
for i’ve done
i’ll start
and whatever pain may come
today ends
i’m forgiving i’ve …
done
i'll face
to cross i’ve become
erase
and let go i’ve done
what i’ve done
forgiving i’ve done
away thanks

aalis na nga
maaari bang hawakan
ang iyong mga kamay
sana ay maabot ng langit
ang iyong mga ngiti
sana ay maisilip
wag kang magalala
di ko ipipilit sa'yo
kahit na lilipad
ang isip ko'y torete sa'yo
ilang gabi pa nga lang
nang tayo'y pinagtagpo
na parang may tumulak
nanlalamig nanginginig na ako
akala ko nung una
may bukas ang ganito
mabuti pang umiwas
torete torete torete ako
torete torete torete sa'yo
wag kang magalala
di ko ipipilit sa'yo
kahit na lilipad

a farmer and a teacher a hooker and a preacher riding on a midnight
bus bound for mexico one was headed for vacation one for higher
education and two of them were searching for lost souls
that driver never ever saw the stop sign and eighteen wheelers
can't stop on a dime
there are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
why there's not four of them heaven only knows i guess it's not what you
take when you leave this world behind you it's what you leave behind you
when you go
that farmer left a harvest a home and eighty acres the faith and
love for growing things in his young son's heart and that teacher left
her wisdom in the minds of lots of children did her best to give them all
better start
and that preacher whispered can't you see the promised land as he
lay his bloodstained bible in that hookers hands
there are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
why there's not four of them heaven only knows i guess it's not what you
take when you leave this world behind you it's what you leave behind you
when you go
that's the story that our preacher told last sunday as he held his
bloodstained bible up for all of us to see he said bless the farmer and
teacher and that preacher who gave this bible to my momma who read it to me
there are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
why there's not four of them now i guess we know it's not what you
take when you leave this world behind you it's what you leave behind you
when you go
there are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
i set narrow way many years ago

there's one day next day gone
sometimes bend sometimes stand sometimes turn back wind
there's world outside every darkened door
where blues haunt anymore
where brave free lovers soar come ride distant shore
we hesitate break garden gate
there's much time left today
life highway i wanna ride night long
if going way i wanna drive night long
through cities towns

you hate enough love is supposed enough
i wish friend then i hurt end
i never claimed saint…
my banished long ago it took death hope let go
so break yourself against my stones
and spit your pity in my soul
you never needed any help
you sold me out to save yourself
and i won't listen to your shame
you ran away you're all the same
angels lie to keep control…
my love was punished long ago
if you still care don't ever let me know
if still care let know…

wenn man will bist du das ziel einer langen reise
die perfektion der besten art und weise stillen momenten leise
die schaumkrone der woge der begeisterung bergauf mein antrieb und schwung
ich wollte dir nur mal eben sagen dass du das größte für mich bist
und sicher gehn ob du denn das selbe für mich fühlst für mich fühlst
wenn man will bist du meine chillout area meine feiertage jedem jahr
meine süßwarenabteilung im supermarkt
die lösung wenn mal hakt wertvoll das man es sich gerne aufspart
und schön das man nie darauf verzichten mag
ich wollte dir nur mal eben sagen dass du das größte für mich bist
und sicher gehn ob du denn das selbe für mich fühlst für mich fühlst
ich wollte dir nur mal eben sagen dass du das größte für mich bist

what's wrong world mama
people livin' ain't got mamas
i think whole world addicted drama
only attracted things that'll bring trauma
overseas yeah try stop terrorism
but still got terrorists livin'
in usa big cia
the bloods the crips kkk
but love race
then leave space discriminate
and discriminate generates hate
and hate bound irate yeah
badness demonstrate
and exactly anger works operates
n' gotta love set straight
take control mind meditate
people killin' people dyin'
children hurt hear cryin'
can practice preach
and turn cheek
father father father help us
send us guidance
'cause people got got questionin'
where love love
where love the love
where love the love
where love
the love love
it ain't always unchanged
new days strange world insane
if love peace strong
why pieces love belong
chemical gasses fillin' lungs little ones
with ongoin' sufferin' youth die young
so ask lovin' really gone
so i ask really goin' wrong
in world livin' people keep givin'
makin' wrong decisions visions dividends
not respectin' deny thy brother
a war goin' reason's undercover
the truth kept secret swept rug
if never know truth never know love

selfishness got us followin' wrong direction
wrong information always shown media
negative images main criteria
infecting young minds faster bacteria
kids wanna act see cinema

whatever happened fairness equality
instead spreading love spreading animosity
lack understanding leading lives away unity

from dusty mesa
her looming shadow grows
hidden branches
poison creosote
she twines spines slowly
towards boiling sun
and i touched skin
my fingers ran blood
in hushing dusk
under swollen silver moon
i came walking wind
to watch cactus bloom
a strange hunger haunted
the looming shadows danced
i fell thorny brush
and felt trembling hand
when last light warms rocks
and rattlesnakes unfold
mountain cats will come
drag away bones
and rise forever
across silent sand
and stars will eyes
and winds will hands
when nowhere run
is room one son
one son
if hold
if hold hold
i want stand i want let go

and listened engine roar
my broken house behind good things ahead
a girl named cathy wants little time
six cylinders underneath hood crashing kicking
ahah listen engine whine
i going make year
if kills
i going make year
if kills
i played video games drunken haze
i years young
hurt knuckles punching machines
the taste scotch rich tongue
and cathy showed hung
trading swigs bottle bitter clean
locking eyes holding hands
twin high maintenance machines
i going make year
if kills
i going make year
if kills
i drove home california dusk
i feel alcohol inside hum
pictured look stepfather's face
ready bad things come
i downshifted i pulled driveway
the motor screaming stuck second gear
the scene ends badly might imagine
in cavalcade anger fear
there will feasting dancing jerusalem next year
i going make year
if kills
i going make year
if kills


when i see smile
tears run face i replace
and now i'm stronger i've figured
how world turns cold breaks soul
and i know i'll find deep inside i one
i will never let fall
i'll stand forever
i'll
even saving sends heaven
it's ok it's ok it's ok
seasons changing
and waves crashing
and stars falling us

i'll stand forever
i'll
even saving sends heaven
cuz true love whole heart
please throw away

ich fühle du willst aber ich hör' dich nicht ich
hab' mir ein wörterbuch geliehen dir a bis z ins ohr geschrien
ich stapel tausend wirre worte auf die dich ärmel ziehn
und wo du hingehen willst ich häng' deinen beinen

wie du dein hübsches köpfchen neigst
und der ganzen lauten welt und mir die kalte schulter zeigst
dein schweigen ist dein zelt du stellst es mitten die welt
spannst die schnüre und staunst stumm
wenn nachts ein mädchen drüber fällt
zu deinen füssen red' ich mich um kopf und kragen
ich will deine tiefen wasser große wellen schlagen
oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh
bitte gib mir nur ein bitte bitte gib mir nur ein oh
oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh
bitte gib mir nur ein bitte bitte gib mir nur ein wort
in meinem blut werfen die endorphine blasen
wenn hinter deinen stillen hasenaugen die gedanken rasen

you know i chicken fried
cold beer friday night
a pair jeans fit right
and radio
well i raised beneath shade georgia pine
and that`s home know
sweet tea pecan pie homemade wine
where peaches grow
and house it`s much talk
but it`s filled love that`s grown southern ground
and little bit chicken fried
cold beer friday night
a pair jeans fit right
and radio
well i`ve seen sunrise
see love woman`s eyes
feel touch precious child
and know mother`s love
well it`s funny it`s little things life mean
not live car drive price tag clothes
there`s dollar sign peace mind i`ve come know
so agree drink
raise glasses toast
to little bit chicken fried
cold beer friday night
a pair jeans fit right
and radio
well i`ve seen sunrise
see love woman`s eyes
feel touch precious child
and know mother`s love
i thank god life
and stars stripes
may freedom forever fly let ring
salute ones died
the ones give lives don`t sacrifice
all things love
like chicken fried
and cold beer friday night
a pair jeans fit right
and radio
well i`ve seen sunrise
see love woman`s eyes
feel touch precious child
and know mother`s love
getcha little chicken fried
a cold beer friday night
a pair jeans fit right
and radio
well i`ve seen sunrise
see love woman`s eyes
feel touch precious child
and know mother`s love
