a hundred days have made me older
since the last time that i saw your pretty face
a thousand lies have made me colder
and i don't think i can look at this the same
but all the miles that seperate
they dissapear now when i'm dreaming of your face
i'm here without you baby
but you're still on my lonely mind
i think about you baby and i dream about you all the time
i'm here without you baby
but you're still with me in my dreams
and tonight there's only you and me yeah
the miles just keep rollin'
as the people leave their way to say hello
i've heard this life is overrated
but i hope that it gets better as we go ohh yeah yeah
i'm here without you baby
but you're still on my lonely mind
i think about you baby and i dream about you all the time
i'm here without you baby
but you're still with me in my dreams
and tonight there's only you and me yeah
everything i know and everywhere i go
it gets hard but it won't take away my love
and when the last one falls and when it's all said and done
it gets hard but it won't take away my love whoa
i'm here without you baby
but you're still on my lonely mind
i think about you baby and i dream about you all the time
i'm here without you baby
but you're still with me in my dreams
and tonight girl there's only you and me yeah ohh yeah
ohhh i'm alone
i took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
i left my body lyin somewhere in the sands of time
i watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
i feel there's nothin i can do yeah
i watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
after all i knew it had to be somethin to do with you
i really don't mind what happens now and then
as long as you'll be my friend at the end
if i go crazy then will you still call me superman
if i'm alive and well will you be there a holdin my hand
i'll keep you by my side with my super human might kryptonite
you call me strong you call me weak but still your secrets i will keep
you took for granted all the times i never let you down
you stumble again and bump your head if not for me then you'd be dead
i picked you up and put you back on solid ground
if i go crazy then will you still call me superman
if i'm alive and well will you be there a holdin my hand
i'll keep you by my side with my super human might kryptonite
if i go crazy then will you still call me superman
if i'm alive and well will you be there a holdin my hand
i'll keep you by my side with my super human might kryptonite
if i go crazy then will you still call me superman
if i'm alive and well will you be there a holdin my hand
i'll keep you by my side with my super human might kryptonite

i've made up my mind don't need to think it over
if i'm wrong i am right don't need to look no further
this ain't lust i know this is love but
if i tell the world i'll never say enough
'cause it was not said to you
and that's exactly what i need to do if i'd end up with you
should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere
or would it be a waste even if i knew my place
should i leave it there
should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere
i build myself up and fly around in circles
waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
finally could this be it or
should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere
or would it be a waste even if i knew my place
should i leave it there
should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere
should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere
or would it be a waste even if i knew my place
should i leave it there should i give up
or should i just keep on chasing pavements
should i just keep on chasing pavements
or
should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere
or would it be a waste even if i knew my place
should i leave it there
should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere

i've been walking in the same way as i did
missing out the cracks in the pavement
and tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"is there anything i can do for you dear is there anyone i could call"
"no one thank you please madam i ain't lost just wandering"
round my hometown
memories are fresh
round my hometown
ooh the people i've met
are the wonders of my world
are the wonders of my world
are the wonders of this world
are the wonders now
i like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
i love to see everybody in short skirts shorts and shades
i like it in the city when two worlds collide
you get the people and the government
everybody taking different sides
shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
shows that we are united
shows that we ain't gonna take it
shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
shows that we are united
round my hometown
memories are fresh
round my hometown
ooh the people i've met
are the wonders of my world
are the wonders of my world
are the wonders of this world
are the wonders of my world
when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love
when evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love
i know you haven't made your mind up yet
but i would never do you wrong
i've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong
i'd go hungry i'd go black and blue
i'd go crawling down the avenue
no there's nothing that i wouldn't do
to make you feel my love
the storms are raging on the rollin' sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet
i could make you happy make your dreams come true
there’s nothing that i would not do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love
to make you feel my love
i could go off the deep end
i could kill all my best friends
i can follow those stylish trends
and god knows i could make amends
but i've got an angry heart filled with cancers and poppy tarts
if this is how you folks make art it's fucking depressing
and it's sad to know that we are not alone
and it's sad to know there's no honest way out
i'm afraid to leave the house
i'm as timid as a mouse
i'm afraid if i go out
i'll outwear my welcome
i am not a courageous man
i don't have any big lasting plans
i'm too cowardly to take a stand
i wanna keep my nose clean
and it's sad to know that we're not alone in this
and it's sad to know there's no honest way out
in this life we lead we could conquer everything
if we could just get the braves to get out of
bed in the morning
let it be christmas everywhere
in the hearts of all people both near and far
christmas everywhere
feel the love of the season wherever you are
on the small country roads lined with green mistletoe
big city streets where a thousand lights glow
let it be christmas everywhere
let heavenly music fill the air
let every heart sing let every bell ring
the story of hope and joy and peace
and let it be christmas everywhere
let heavenly music fill the air
let anger and fear and hate disappear
let there be love that lasts through the year
and let it be christmas christmas everywhere
let it be christmas everywhere
with the gold and the silver the green and the red
christmas everywhere
on the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
in the eyes of young babies their first fallen snow
elderly's memories that never grow old
let it be christmas everywhere
let heavenly music fill the air
let every heart sing let every bell ring
the story of hope and joy and peace
and let it be christmas everywhere
let heavenly music fill the air
let anger and fear and hate disappear
let there be love that lasts through the year
and let it be christmas christmas everywhere
let it be christmas everywhere
in the songs that we sing and the gifts that we bring
christmas everywhere
in what this day means and what we believe
from the sandy white beaches where blue water rolls
to snow covered mountains and valleys below
let it be christmas everywhere
let heavenly music fill the air
let every heart sing let every bell ring
the story of hope and joy and peace
and let it be christmas everywhere
let heavenly music fill the air
let anger and fear and hate disappear
let there be love that lasts through the year
and let it be christmas christmas everywhere
christmas everywhere
christmas everywhere
remember when i was young so were you
time stood still and love was all we knew
you were the first so was i
we made love and then you cried
remember when
remember when we vowed the vows and walk the walk
gave our hearts made the start and it was hard
we lived and learned life threw curves
there was joy and there was hurt
remember when
remember when old ones die and new were born
life was changed disassembled rearranged
we came together fell apart
we broke each others hearts
remember when


e||||
e||
remember when the sound of little feet
was the music we danced to week to week
brought back the love we found trust
vowed we'd never give it up
remember when
remember when thirty seemed so old
now looking back it's just a steppin stone
to where we are where we've been
said we'd do it all again
remember when
remember when we said when we'd turn grey
when the children grow up and move away
we won't be sad we'll be glad
for all the life we've had
and we'll remember when
remember when
remember when
on a hill far away stood a old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
so i'll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown
to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it's shame and reproach gladly bear
then he'll call me some day to my home far away
where his glory forever i'll share
so i'll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown
o soul are you weary and troubled
no light in the darkness you see
there's light for a look at the saviour
and life more abundant and free
turn your eyes upon jesus
look full in his wonderful face
and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
in the light of his glory and grace
through death into life everlasting
he passed and we follow him there
over us sin no more hath dominion
for more than conqu'rors we are
turn your eyes upon jesus
look full in his wonderful face
and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
in the light of his glory and grace
his word shall not fail you he promised
believe him and all will be well
then go to a world that is dying
his perfect salvation to tell
turn your eyes upon jesus
look full in his wonderful face
and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
in the light of his glory and grace

years ago when i was younger
i kinda liked a girl i knew
she was mine and we were sweethearts
that was then but then it's true
i'm in love with a fairytale even though it hurts
'cause i don't care if i lose my mind
i'm already cursed
every day we start a fighting
every night we fell in love
no one else could make me sadder
but no one else could lift me high above
i don't know what i was doing
when suddenly we fell apart
now a days i cannot find her
but when i do we'll get a brand new start
i'm in love with a fairytale even though it hurts
'cause i don't care if i lose my mind
i'm already cursed
she's a fairytale yeah even though it hurts
'cause i don't care if i lose my mïnd
i'm already cursed

i heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don’t really care for music do ya
well it goes like this
the fourth the fifth
the minor fall and the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleluuuuujah
well your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
she tied you to her kitchen chair
and she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleluuuuujah
e|||||
e|||||
well maybe there’s a god above
but all i’ve ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who’d out drew ya
and it’s not a cry that you hear at night
it’s not someone who’s seen the light
it’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleluuuuu
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleluuuuujah
hallelujah halleluuuuujah

he woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
started making his way past two in the morning
he hasn't been sober for days
leaning now into the breeze
remembering sunday he falls to his knees
they had breakfast together
but two eggs don't last
like the feeling of what he needs
now this place seems familiar to him
she pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
she led him upstairs she led him upstairs
left him dying to get in
forgive me i'm trying to find
my calling i'm calling at night
but have you seen this girl
she's been running through my dreams
and it's driving me crazy it seems
i'm gonna ask her to marry me
even though she doesn't believe in love
he's determined to call her bluff
who could deny these butterflies
waking the neighbors unfamiliar faces
he pleads though he tries
but he's only denied
now he's dying to get inside
forgive me i'm trying to find
my calling i'm calling at night
i don't mean to be a bother
but have you seen this girl
she's been running through my dreams
and it's driving me crazy it seems
i'm gonna ask her to marry me
the neighbors said she moved away
funny how it rained all day
i didn't think much of it then
but it's starting to all make sense
oh i can see now that all of these clouds
are following me in my desperate endeavor
to find my whoever whoever she may be
i'm not coming back i've done something so terrible
i'm terrified to speak but you'd expect that from me
i'm mixed up i'll be blunt now the rain is just
washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
keeping an eye on the world
so many thousands of feet off the ground
i'm over you now i'm at home in the clouds
towering over your head
i guess i'll go home now
i guess i'll go home now
i guess i'll go home now
i guess i'll go home
leaves are on the ground
fall has come
blue skies turning grey
like my love
i try to carry you
and make you whole
but it was never enough
i must go
and who is gonna save you when i’m gone
and who’ll watch over you
when i’m gone
you say you care for me
but hide it well
how can you love someone not yourself
and who is gonna save you when i’m gone
and who’ll watch over you
and when i’m gone who will break your fall
who'll you blame
i can’t go on let you loose it all its more then i can take
who’ll ease your pain
ease your pain
and who is gonna save you when i’m gone
and who’ll watch over you
and who will give you strength when you’re not strong
who’ll watch over you when i’m gone away
snow is on the ground
winter’s come
you long to hear my voice
but i’m long gone
sweet pea
apple of my eye
don't know when and i don't know why
you're the only reason i keep on coming home
sweet pea
what's all this about
don't get your way all you do is fuss and pout
you're the only reason i keep on coming home
i'm like the rock of gibraltar
i always seem to falter
and the words just get in the way
oh i know i'm gonna crumble
i'm trying to stay humble
but i never think before i say
sweet pea
keeper of my soul
i know sometimes i'm out of control
you're the only reason i keep on coming
you're the only reason i keep on coming yeah
you're the only reason i keep on coming home
oh the wind whistles down
the cold dark street tonight
and the people they were dancing to the music vibe
and the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
while the shy tormented youth sit way over there
and the songs they get louder
each one better than before
and you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
and you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
where you gonna go where you gonna go
where you gonna sleep tonight
and you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
and you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
where you gonna go where you gonna go
where you gonna sleep tonight
where you gonna sleep tonight
so you're heading down the road in your taxi for four
and you're waiting outside jimmy's front door
but nobody's in and nobody's home 'til four
so you're sitting there with nothing to do
talking about robert riger and his motley crew
and where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight
and you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
and you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
where you gonna go where you gonna go
where you gonna sleep tonight
and you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
and you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
where you gonna go where you gonna go
where you gonna sleep tonight
where you gonna sleep tonight
and you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
and you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
where you gonna go where you gonna go
where you gonna sleep tonight
and you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
and you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
where you gonna go where you gonna go
where you gonna sleep tonight
and you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
and you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
where you gonna go where you gonna go
where you gonna sleep tonight
and you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
and you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
where you gonna go where you gonna go
where you gonna sleep tonight
where you gonna sleep tonight
he left no time to regret
kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet
me and my head high
and my tears dry get on without my guy
you went back to what you knew
so far removed from all that we went through
and i tread a troubled track
my odds are stacked i'll go back to black
we only said goodbye with words i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back toi go back to us
i love you much
it's not enough you love blow and i love puff
and life is like a pipe
and i'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside
we only said goodbye with words i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
we only said goodbye with words i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
black black
black black
black black
black i go back to i go back to
we only said goodbye with words i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
we only said goodbye with words i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to black
for you i was a flame love is a losing game
five story fire as you came love is a losing game
one i wish i never played oh what a mess we made
and now the final frame love is a losing game
played out by the band love is a losing hand
more than i could stand love is a losing hand
self professed profound 'till the chips were down
know you’re a gambling man love is a losing hand
though i battle blind love is a fate resigned
memories mar my mind love is a fate resigned
over futile odds and laughed at by the gods
and now the final frame love is a losing game
they try to make me go to rehab i say no no no
yes i've been black but when i come back you'll know know know

they try to make me go to rehab i say no no no

you should be stronger than me
you been here seven years longer than me
don't you know you're 'sposed to be the man
not pale in comparison to who you think i am
you always wanna talk it through i don't care
i always have to comfort you when i'm there
but that's what i need you to do stroke my hair
'cos i've forgotten all of young love's joy
feel like a lady but you my lady boy
you should be stronger than me
but instead you're longer than frozen turkey
why'd you always put me in control
all i need is for my man to live up to his role
always wanna talk it through i'm ok
always have to comfort you every day
but that's what i need you to do are you gay
'cos i've forgotten all of young love's joy
feel like a lady but you my lady boy
he said "the respect i made you earn
thought you had so many lessons to learn"
i said "you don't know what love is get a grip
sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script"
i'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
i just wanna grip your body over mine
please tell me why you think that's a crime
'cos i've forgotten all of young love's joy
feel like a lady but you my lady boy
you should be stronger than me
you should be stronger than me
you should be stronger than me
you should be stronger than me
all i can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew
and this regret i got accustomed to
once it was so right when we were at our high
waiting for you in the hotel at night
i knew i hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatch
i don't know why i got so attached
it's my responsibility and you don't owe nothing to me
but to walk away i have no capacity
he walks away the sun goes down
he takes the day but i'm grown
and in your grey in this blue shade
my tears dry on their own
i don't understand why do i stress a man
when there's so many better things at hand
we could a never had it all we had to hit a wall
so this is inevitable withdrawal
even if i stop wanting you a perspective pushes through
i'll be some next man's other woman soon
i can't play myself again i should just be my own best friend
not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
he walks away the sun goes down
he takes the day but i'm grown
and in your grey in this blue shade
my tears dry on their own
so we are history your shadow covers me the sky above a blaze
he walks away the sun goes down
he takes the day but i'm grown
and in your grey in this blue shade my tears dry on their own
i wish i could say no regrets and no emotional debts
'cos as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
so we are history the shadow covers me
the sky above a blaze that only lovers see
he walks away the sun goes down
he takes the day but i'm grown
and in your grey in this blue shade
my tears dry on their own
he walks away the sun goes down
he takes the day but i'm grown
and in your grey in this blue shade
my tears dry on their own
he walks away the sun goes down
he takes the day but i'm grown
and in your grey in this blue shade
my tears dry

am and she calls me cause i'm still awake
"can you help me unravel my latest mistake
i don't love him winter just wasn't my season"
yeah we walk through the doors so accusing their eyes
like they have any right at all to criticize
hypocrites you're all here for the very same reason
cause you can't jump the track
we're like cars on a cable
and life's like an hourglass glued to the table
no one can find the rewind button girl
so cradle your head in your hands
and breathe just breathe whoa breathe just breathe
in may he turned on the base of fort bliss
"just a day" he said down to the flask in his fist
"ain't been sober since maybe october of last year"
and here in town you can tell he's been down for a while
but my god it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
wanna hold him maybe i'll just sing about it
cause you can't jump the track
we're like cars on a cable
and life's like an hourglass glued to the table
no one can find the rewind button boys
so cradle your head in your hands
and breathe just breathe whoa breathe just breathe
there's a light at each end of this tunnel
you shout cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
and these mistakes you've made you'll just make them again
if you only try turnin' around
am and i'm still awake writing a song
if i get it all down on paper it's no longer inside of me
threatnin' the life it belongs to
and i feel like i'm naked in front of the crowd
cause these words are my diary screamin' out loud
and i know that you'll use them however you want to
cause you can't jump the track
we're like cars on a cable
and life's like an hourglass glued to the table
no one can find the rewind button now
sing it if you understand
and breathe just breathe whoa breathe just breathe
whoa breathe just breathe whoa breathe just breathe

i'm going back to if it's a hour flight
or a fortyfive minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs
stop and wait a sec when you look at me like that
my darling what did you expect i probably still adore you
with your hands around my neck or i did last time i checked
i'm not shy of a spark
the knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite no it's no harsher than the bark
a middle of adventure such a perfect place to start
i'm going back to if it's a hour flight
or a fortyfive minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs
but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon
i'm going back to if it's a hour flight
or a minute drive in my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile
well oh they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there
and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see them then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there
you know oh it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way
'cause over there there's broken bones
there's only music so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here
don't get me wrong oh there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just cause he's had a coupla cans
he thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead
don't you know oh it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way
but i said no
oh no
well you won't get me to go
not anywhere not anywhere
no i won't go
oh no no
well over there there's friends of mine
what can i say i've known 'em for a long long time
and yeah they might overstep the line
but i just cannot get angry in the same way
no not in the same way
said in the same way
oh no oh no no
baby i'm yours
and i'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
yours until the rivers all run dry
in other words until i die
baby i'm yours
and i'll be yours until the sun no longer shines
yours until the poets run out of rhyme
in other words until the end of time
i'm gonna stay right here by your side
do my best to keep you satisfied
nothin' in the world can drive me away
every day you'll hear me say
baby i'm yours baby i'm yours
and i'll be yours yours until two and two is three
yours yours until the mountains crumble to the sea
in other words until eternity
baby i'm yours
'til the stars fall from the sky
baby i'm yours
'til the rivers all run dry
baby i'm yours
'til the sun no longer shines
baby i'm yours
'til the poets run out of rhyme
i thought i saw you in the battleship
but it was only a lookalike
she was nothing but a vision trick
under the warning light
she was close close enough to be your ghost
but my chances turned to toast
when i asked her if i could call her your name
i thought i saw you in the rusty hook
huddled up in a wicker chair
i wandered over for a closer look
and kissed whoever was sitting there
she was close and she held me very tightly
'til i asked awfully politely please
can i call you her name
and i elongated my lift home
yeah i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself
i thought i saw you in the parrot's beak
messing with the smoke alarm
it was too loud for me to hear her speak
and she had a broken arm
it was close so close that the walls were wet
and she wrote it out in letraset
no you can't call me her name
tell me where's your hiding place
i'm worried i'll forget your face
and i've asked everyone
i'm beginning to think i imagined you all along
and i elongated my lift home
yeah i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself
i saw your sister in the cornerstone
on the phone to the middle man
when i saw that she was on her own
i thought she might understand
she was close well you couldn't get much closer
she said i'm really not supposed to but yes
you can call me anything you want

you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
the bloody mary's lacking her tabasco
remember when you used to be a rascal
oh the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
but as daft as they seem
as daft as they seem
my love when you dream them up
flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric
now when she's told she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said she wasn't going but she went still
likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil
oh the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
but as daft as they seem
as daft as they seem
my love when you dream them up
oh flo where did you go
where did you go
where did you go woah
falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just sounding it out
you're not coming back again
falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just sounding it out
you're not coming back again
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal

well now then mardy bum
i've seen your frown and it's like
looking down the barrel of a gun
and it goes off
and out come all these words
oh there's a very pleasant side to you
a side i much prefer it's one that
laughs and jokes around
remember cuddles in the kitchen yeah
to get things off the ground and it was
up up and away
oh but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today when you're
all argumentative and you've got the face on
well now then mardy bum
oh i'm in trouble again
aren't i i thought as much
coz you've turned over there
pulling that silent disappointment face
the one that i can't bear well can't we
just laugh and joke around
remember cuddles in the kitchen yeah
to get things off the ground and it was
up up and away
oh but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today when you're
all argumentative and you've got the face on
and yeah i'm sorry i was late
but i missed the train and then the traffic was a state
and i can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs
oh when you say i don't care but of course i do
yeah i clearly do
so laugh and joke around
remember cuddles in the kitchen yeah
to get things off the ground and it was
up up and away
oh but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today when you're all break wait a bar
argumentative and you've got the face on

lady where has your love gone
i was looking but can't find it anywhere
they always offer when there's loads of love around
but when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found
well i know your game you told him yesterday
no chance you'll get nothin' from me
but now she's there you're there everybody's there
he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be
just like me
lets go down down low down
where i know i should not go
oh and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in
and just cause everybody's doin' it
does that mean that i can too
lady where has your love gone
he was the antiseptic to the sore
to hold you by the hand must be first be in demand
how he longs for you to long for him once more
just once more
lets go down down low down
where i know i should not go
oh and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in
and just cause everybody's doin' it
does that mean that i can too
her eyes went down and cut you up
and there's nothing like a dirty look from
the one you want or the one you've lost
an ache in your soul is everybody's goal
to get what they can't have
that's why your after her and that's why she's after him
but saying it won't change a thing
and they'll realize that it won't change a thing
realizing it won't change a thing

in a foreign place the saving grace was the feeling
and that it was a heart that he was stealing
oh he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
the eyes are bright he couldn't wait to get away
i bet the juliet was just the icing on the cake
make no mistake no
and even if somehow we could have shown you the place you wanted
well i'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
and i bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
well all the little promises they don't mean much
when there's memories to be made
and i hope you're holding hands by new year's eve
they made it far too easy to believe
that true romance can't be acheived these days
and even if somehow we could have shown you the place you wanted
well i'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
you are the only ones who know
f

so who's that girl there
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences
and i've seen him with girls of the night
and he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
cause he's a scumbag don't you know
i said he's a scumbag don't you know

and oh he must be up to summat
want half a chance to show he's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be
they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around
and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous
and he don't have to say 'owt
she understands she's here to get picked up
and she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
she don't stop in the winter no and
they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around here
what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all

i walk the streets of japan till i get lost
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
with a graveyard tan carrying a cross
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
i like studying faces in a parking lot
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
i like driving backwards in the fog
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
the things that i've loved the things that i've lost
the things i've held sacred that i've dropped
i won't lie no more you can bet
i don't wanna learn what i'll need to forget
i like gypsy moths and radio talk
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
i like gospel music and canned applause
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
i like colorful clothing in the sun
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
i like hammering nails and speaking in tongues
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
the things that i've loved the things that i've lost
the things i've held sacred that i've dropped
i won't lie no more you can bet
i don't wanna learn what i'll need
bend and shape me
i love the way you are
slow and sweetly
like never before
calm and sleeping
we won't stir up the past
so discreetly
we won't look back
the things that i've loved the things that i've lost
the things i've held sacred that i've dropped
i won't lie no more you can bet
i don't wanna learn what i'll need
i like throwing my voice and breaking guitars
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
i like playing in the sand what's mine is ours
if it doesn't remind me of anything

pearls and swine bereft of me
long and weary my road has been
i was lost in the cities
alone in the hills
no sorrow or pity for leaving i feel

i am not your rolling wheels
i am the highway
i am not your carpet ride
i am the sky
friends and liars don't wait for me
cause i'll get on all by myself
i put millions of miles
under my heels
and still too close to you i feel
i am not your rolling wheels
i am the highway
i am not your carpet ride
i am the sky
i am not your blowing wind
i am the lightning
i am not your autumn moon i am
the night the night
i am not your rolling wheels
i am the highway
i am not your carpet ride
i am the sky
i am not your blowing wind
i am the lightning
i am not your autumn moon i am
the night the night
yeah yeah
as little children we would dream of christmas morn
and all the gifts and toys we knew we'd find
but we never realised a baby born one blessed
night gave us the greatest gift of our lives
we are the reason that he gave his life
we are the reason that he suffered and died
to a world that was lost he gave all he could
give to show us the reason to live
as the years go by we learned more about gifts
giving of ourselves and what that means
on a dark and cloudy day a man hung crying
in the rain because of love because of love
i've finally found a reason for living
it's in giving every part of my heart to him
in all that i do every word that i say
i'll be giving my all just for him for him
and we are the reason that he gave his life
we are the reason that he suffered and died
to a world that was lost
he gave all he could give
to show us the reason to live
he is my reason to live
a lonely road crossed another cold state line
miles away from those i love purpose hard to find
while i recall all the words you spoke to me
can't help but wish that i was there
back where i'd love to be oh yeah
dear god the only thing i ask of you is
to hold her when i'm not around
when i'm much too far away
we all need that person who can be true to you
but i left her when i found her
and now i wish i'd stayed
’cause i'm lonely and i'm tired
i'm missing you again oh no
once again
there's nothing here for me on this barren road
there's no one here while the city sleeps
and all the shops are closed
can't help but think of the times i've had with you
pictures and some memories will have to help me through oh yeah
dear god the only thing i ask of you is
to hold her when i'm not around
when i'm much too far away
we all need that person who can be true to you
i left her when i found her
and now i wish i'd stayed
’cause i'm lonely and i'm tired
i'm missing you again oh no
once again
some search never finding a way
before long they waste away
i found you something told me to stay
i gave in to selfish ways
and how i miss someone to hold
a lonely road crossed another cold state line
miles away from those i love purpose hard to find
dear god the only thing i ask of you is
to hold her when i'm not around
when i'm much too far away

he was a boy she was a girl can i make it any more obvious
he was a punk she did ballet what more can i say
he wanted her she'd never tell that secretly she wanted him as well
but all of her friends stuck up their nose they had a problem with his
baggy clothes
he was a skater boy she said see you later boy
he wasn't good enough for her
she had a pretty face but her head was up in space
she needed to come back down to earth
five years from now she sits at home
feeding the baby she's all alone
she turns on tv guess who she sees
skater boy rocking up mtv
she calls up her friends they already know
and they've all got tickets to see his show
she tags along stands in the crowd
looks up at the man that she turned down
he was a skater boy she said see you later boy
he wasn't good enough for her
now he's a super star slamming on his guitar
does your pretty face see what he's worth
he was a skater boy she said see you later boy
he wasn't good enough for her
now he's a super star slamming on his guitar
does your pretty face see what he's worth
sorry girl but you missed out
well tough luck that boy's mine now
we are more than just good friends
this is how the story ends
too bad that you couldn't see
see the man that boy could be
there is more than meets the eye
i see the soul that is inside
he's just a boy and i'm just a girl
can i make it any more obvious
we are in love haven't you heard how we rock each other's world
i'm with the skater boy i said see you later boy
i'll be backstage after the show
i'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
about a girl you used to know
i'm with the skater boy i said see you later boy
i'll be back stage after the show

about a girl you used to know

and the days feel like years when i'm alone
and the bed where you lie is made up on your side
when you walk away i count the steps that you take
do you see how much i need you right now
when you're gone the pieces of my heart are missing you
when you're gone the face i came to know is missing too
when you're gone the words i need to hear
to always get me through the day and make it okay

when you're gone the pieces of my heart are missing you
when you're gone the face i came to know is missing too

it's christmastime there's no need to be afraid
at christmastime we let in light and we banish shade
and in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
throw your arms around the world at christmastime
but say a prayer pray for the other ones
at christmastime it's hard but when you're having fun
there's a world outside your window
and it's a world of dread and fear
where the only water flowing
is the bitter sting of tears
and the christmas bells that ring there
are the clanging chimes of doom
well tonight thank god it's them instead of you
and there won't be snow in africa this christmastime
the greatest gift they'll get this year is life ohhhh
where nothing ever grows
no rain nor rivers flow
do they know it's christmastime at all
here's to you
raise a glass for everyone
spare a thought this yuletide for the deprived
if the table was turned would you survive
here's to them
underneath that burning sun
you ain't gotta feel guilt just selfless
give a little help to the helpless
do they know it's christmastime at
all
feed the world
feed the world
feed the world
feed the world
feed the world
let them know it's christmastime again
feed the world
let them know it's christmastime again
feed the world
let them know it's christmastime again
feed the world
let them know it's christmastime again
feed the world repeat to fade

i'm coming up only to hold you under
and coming up only to show you're wrong
and to know you is hard we wonder
to know you all wrong we warn

really too late to call so we wait for
morning to wake you is all we got
to know me as hardly golden
is to know me all wrong they warn
at every occasion i'll be ready for the funeral
and every occasion once more it's called the funeral
at every occasion oh i'm ready for the funeral
and every occasion oh one billion day funeral
i'm coming up only to show you're down for
and coming up only to show you're wrong
to the outside the dead leaves lay on the lawn
for they don't have trees to hang upon
oooooooooooh
oooooooooooh
at every occasion i'll be ready for the funeral
and every occasion once more it's called the funeral
at every occasion oh i'm ready for the funeral
and every occasion oh one billion day funeral
if i was young i'd flee this town i'd bury my dreams under ground
as did i we drink to die we drink toni i ight
far from home elephant guns let's take them down one by one
we'll lay it down it's not been found it's not aro o ound
let the seasons begin it rolls right on
let the seasons begin take the big king down
let the seasons begin it rolls right on
let the seasons begin take the big king down
oh oh oh oh oh la la la
and it rips through the silence of our camp at night
and it rips through the night oh la la la
and it rips through the silence of our camp at night
and it rips through the silence all that is left is all i hide
elope with me miss private and we’ll sail around the world
i will be your ferdinand and you my wayward girl
how many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take
how many nights of limping round on pagan holidays
oh elope with me in private and we’ll set something ablaze
a trail for the devil to erase
san francisco’s calling us the giants and mets will play
piazza new york catcher are you straight or are you gay
we hung about the stadium we’ve got no place to stay
we hung about the tenderloin and tenderly you tell
about the saddest book you ever read it always makes you cry
the statue’s crying too and well he may
i love you i’ve a drowning grip on your adoring face
i love you my responsibility has found a place
beside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
“you’ll take care of her i know it you will do a better job”
maybe but not what she deserves
elope with me miss private and we’ll drink ourselves awake
we’ll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
a privy seal to keep the feel of style
we’ll comment on the decor and we’ll help the passer by
and at dusk when work is over we’ll continue the debate
in a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare
the catcher hits for and catches every day
the pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
he goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
he knows the drink affects his speed he’s praying for
back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
life outside the diamond is a wrench
i wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
i know it wouldn’t come to love my heroine pretend
a lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
you’d settle for an epitaph like “walk away renee”
the sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like
meet you at the statue in an hour
meet you at the statue in an hour
i don't get many things right the first time
in fact i am told that a lot
now i know all the wrong turns
the stumbles and falls brought me here
and where was i before the day
that i first saw your lovely face
now i see it every day
and i know
that i am
i am
i am the luckiest
what if i'd been born
fifty years before you
in a house
on the street where you live
maybe i'd be outside
as you passed on your bike
would i know
and in a wide sea of eyes
i see one pair that i recognize
and i know
that i am
i am
i am the luckiest
i love you more than i have
ever found a way to say to you
next door
there's an old man
who lived to his nineties
and one day passed away in his sleep
and his wife she stayed
for a couple of days and passed away
i'm sorry i know that's a
strange way to tell you that i know
we belong
that i know
that i am
i am
i am the luckiest
i'm goin' down to the greyhound station gonna buy a ticket to ride
gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
try and hide my sorrow from the people i meet
and get along with it all
go down where the people say "y'all"
sing a song with a friend
change the shape that i'm in
and get back in the game
and start playin' again
i'd like to stay but i might have to go to start over again
might go back down to texas might go to somewhere that ive never been
and get up in the mornin' and go out at night
and i won't have to go home
get used to bein' alone
change the words to this song
start singin' again
im tired of runnin round lookin for answers to questions that i already know
i could build me a castle of memories just to have somewhere to go
count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again
feed the pigeons some clay
turn the night into day
start talkin' again when i know what to say
i'm goin' down to the greyhound station gonna buy a ticket to ride
gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
try and hide my sorrow from the people i meet
and get along with it all
go down where the people say "y'all"
feed the pigeons some clay
turn the night into day
start talkin' again when i know what to say
hello there the angel from my nightmare
the shadow in the background of the morgue
the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
we can live like jack and sally if we want
where you can always find me
we'll have halloween on christmas
and in the night we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends
i miss you miss
you i miss you miss you
where are you and i'm so sorry
i cannot sleep i cannot dream tonight
i need somebody and always
this sick strange darkness
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as i stared i counted
webs from all the spiders
catching things and eating their insides
like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
will you come home and stop this pain tonight
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head i miss you miss you
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head i miss you miss you
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head i miss you miss you
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head i miss you miss you
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head i miss you miss you
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head i miss you miss you
i miss you miss
you i miss you miss you

i'll be home for christmas

if only in my dreams
i'll be home for christmas
you can plan on me
please have snow and mistletoe
and presents on the tree

where the lovelight glows

df technically but who cares
well i met you at the blood bank
we were looking at the bags
wondering if any of the colors
matched any of the names we knew on the tags
you said "see look it thats yours
stacked on top with your brother's
see how they resemble one another
even in their plastic little covers"
and i said i know it well
that secret that you knew
but don't know how to tell
it fucks with your honor
and it teases your head
but you know that its good girl
cos its running you with red
then the snow started falling
we were stuck out in your car
you were rubbing both of my hands
chewing on a candy bar
you said "'aint this just like the present
to be showing up like this"
there's a moon waning crescent
we started to kiss
and i said i know it well
that secret that we know
that we don't know how to tell
i'm in love with your honor
i'm in love with your cheeks
what's that noise up the stairs babe
is that christmas morning creaks
and i said i know it well
i am my mother's only one
it's enough
i wear my garment so it shows
now you know
only love is all maroon
gluey feathers on a flume
sky is womb and she's the moon
i am my mother on the wall with us all
i move in water shore to shore
nothing's more
only love is all maroon
lapping lakes like leery loons
leaving rope burns
reddish ruse
only love is all maroon
gluey feathers on a flume
sky is womb and she's the moon
so apropos
snow for every
life forgo the
parable seek the
light my knees are
cold
running home running home running home runniiing hoooome
go find another lover
along with all your
lies still very
lovable i toured the
light so many
foreign roads
for emma foreeever ago
this my excavation and today is kumran
everything that happens is from now on
this is pouring rain
this is paralyzed
i keep throwing it down twohundred at a time
it's hard to find it when you knew it
when your money's gone
and you're drunk as hell
on your back with your racks as the stacks as your load
in the back and the racks and the stacks are your load
in the back with your racks and you're unstacking your load
i've been twisting to the sun i needed to replace
the fountain in the front yard is rusted out
all my love was down
in a frozen ground
there's a black crow sitting across from me his wiry legs are crossed
and he's dangling my keys he even fakes a toss
whatever could it be
that has brought me to this loss
on your back with your racks as the stacks as your load
in the back and the racks and the stacks are your load
in the back with your racks and you're unstacking your load
this is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization
it's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
your love will be
safe with me
come on skinny love just last the year
pour a little salt we were never here
my my my my my my my my
staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
i tell my love to wreck it all
cut out all the ropes and let me fall
my my my my my my my my
right in the moment this order's tall
i told you to be patient
i told you to be fine
i told you to be balanced
i told you to be kind
in the morning i'll be with you
but it will be a different "kind"
i'll be holding all the tickets
and you'll be owning all the fines
come on skinny love what happened here
suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
my my my my my my my my
sullen load is full so slow on the split
i told you to be patient
i told you to be fine
i told you to be balanced
i told you to be kind
now all your love is wasted
then who the hell was i
now i'm breaking at the bridges
and at the end of all your lines
who will love you
who will fight
who will fall far behind
this ain't a song for the brokenhearted
no silent prayer for the faithdeparted
i ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
you're gonna hear my voice
when i shout it out loud
it's my life
it's now or never
i ain't gonna live forever
i just want to live while i'm alive
it's my life
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
i did it my way
i just wanna live while i'm alive
it's my life
this is for the ones who stood their ground
for tommy and gina who never backed down
tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
luck ain't even lucky
got to make your own breaks
it's my life
it's now or never
i ain't gonna live forever
i just want to live while i'm alive
it's my life
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
i did it my way
i just wanna live while i'm alive
'cause it's my life
better stand tall when they're calling you out
don't bend don't break baby don't back down
it's my life
it's now or never
i ain't gonna live forever
i just want to live while i'm alive
it's my life
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
i did it my way
i just wanna live while i'm alive
it's my life
it's now or never
i ain't gonna live forever
i just want to live while i'm alive
it's my life
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
i did it my way
i just wanna live while i'm alive
'cause it's my life
she put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
she broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
we watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
but he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
until the night
he put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
and finally drank away her memory
life is short but this time it was bigger
than the strength he had to get up off his knees
we found him with his face down in the pillow
with a note that said i'll love her till i die
and when we buried him beneath the willow
the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
la la la la la la la lalalalala
la la la la la la la lalalalala
the rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
for years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
she finally drank her pain away a little at a time
but she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
until the night
she put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
and finally drank away his memory
life is short but this time it was bigger
than the strength she had to get up off her knees
we found her with her face down in the pillow
clinging to his picture for dear life
we laid her next to him beneath the willow
while the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
la la la la la la la lalalalala gradually grow softer
la la la la la la la lalalalala
la la la la la la la lalalalala
all of these lines across my face tell you the story of who i am
so many stories of where i've been and how i got to where i am
but these stories don't mean anything when you've got no one to tell them to
it's true i was made for you
i climbed across the mountain tops swimming across the ocean blue
i crossed all the lines and i broke all the rules
but baby i broke them all for you
oh because even when i was flat broke
you made me feel like a million bucks you do
i was made for you
its hiding the words that don't come out
all of my friends who think that i'm blessed
they don't know my head's a mess
no they don't know who i really am
and they don't know what i've been through like you do
and i was made for you
all of these lines across my face tell you the story of who i am
so many stories of where i've been and how i got to where i am
oh but these stories don't mean anything
when you've got no one to tell them to
it's true i was made for you
oh yeah well it's true i was made for you
this is the first day of my life
swear i was born right in the doorway
i went out in the rain suddenly everything changed
they're spreading blankets on the beach
yours is the first face that i saw
think i was blind before i met you
now i don't know where i am i don't know where i've been
but i know where i want to go
and so i thought i'd let you know
yeah these things take forever
i especially am slow
but i realized that i need you and i wondered if i could come home
remember the time you drove all night
just to meet me in the morning
and i thought it was strange you said everything changed
you felt as if you'd just woke up
and you said "this is the first day of my life
i'm glad i didn't die before i met you
but now i don't care i could go anywhere with you
and i'd probably be happy"
so if you want to be with me
with these things there's no telling
we just have to wait and see
but i'd rather be working for a paycheck
besides maybe this time it's different
i mean i really think you like me
i know that it is freezing but i think we have to walk
keep waving at the taxis they keep turning their lights off
but julie knows a party at some actor's westside loft
supplies are endless in the evening by the morning they'll be gone
when everything is lonely i can be my own best friend
i get a coffee and the paper have my own conversations
with the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
the mask i polish in the evening by the morning looks like shit
and i know you have a heavy heart i can feel it when we kiss
so many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
but me i'm not a gamble you can count on me to split
the love i sell you in the evening by the morning won't exist
you're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
well it takes one to know one kid i think you've got it bad
but what's so easy in the evening by the morning's such a drag
i've got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
and if you promise to stay conscious i will try and do the same
yeah we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane
and i'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
the reasons all have run away but the feeling never did
it's not something i would recommend but it is one way to live
'cause what is simple in the moonlight by the morning never is
yeah it was simple in the moonlight now it's so complicated
it was so simple in the moonlight so simple in the moonlight so simple in
the moonlight

i was walking down the street
when out the corner of my eye
i saw a pretty little thing approaching me
she said "i've never seen a man
who looks so all alone
could you use a little company
if you pay the right price
your evening will be nice
and you can go and send me on my way"
i said "you're such a sweet young thing
why you do this to yourself"
she looked at me and this is what she said
"oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
money don't grow on trees
i got bills to pay
i got mouths to feed
there ain't nothing in this world for free
i know i can't slow down
i can't hold back
though you know i wish i could
no there ain't no rest for the wicked
until we close our eyes for good"
not even fifteen minutes later
i'm still walking down the street
when i saw a shadow of a man creep out of sight
then he walks up from behind
and puts a gun up to my head
he made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
he said "give me all you've got
i want your money not your life
but if you try to make a move i won't think twice"
i said "you can have my cash
but first you know i got to ask
what made you want to live this kind of life"
he said "there ain't no rest for the wicked
money don't grow on trees
i got bills to pay
i got mouths to feed
there ain't nothing in this world for free
i know i can't slow down
i can't hold back
though you know i wish i could
no there ain't no rest for the wicked
until we close our eyes for good"
now a couple hours passed
and i was sitting at my house
the day was winding down and coming to an end
so i turned on the tv
and flipped it over to the news
and what i saw i almost couldn't comprehend
i saw a preacher man in cuffs he'd taken money from the church
he's got this bank account with righteous dollar bills
but even still i can't say much
because i know we're all the same
oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
"oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
money don't grow on trees
i got bills to pay
i got mouths to feed
there ain't nothing in this world for free
oh no we can't slow down
we can't hold back
though you know we wish we could
no there ain't no rest for the wicked
until we close our eyes for good"


wala na ang dating pagtingin
sawa na ba sa'king lambing
wala ka namang dahilan
bakit bigla nalang nangiwan
hindi na alam ang gagawin
upang ika’y magbalik sakin
ginawa ko naman ang lahat
bakit bigla nalang naghanap
hindi magbabago
pagmamahal sa iyo
sana’y pakinggan mo
ang awit ng pusong ito
tulad ng mundong hindi
tumitigil sa pagikot
pagibig di mapapagod
tulad ng ilog na hindi
tumitigil sa pag agos
pag ibig di matatapos
alaala’y bumabalik
mga panahong nasasabik
sukdulang mukha ay
laging nasa panaginip
bakit biglang pinagpalit
pagsasamaha'y tila nawaglit
ang dating walang hanggan
nagkaroon ng katapusan
hindi magbabago
pagmamahal sa iyo
sana’y pakinggan mo
ang awit ng pusong ito
tulad ng mundong hindi
tumitigil sa pagikot
pagibig di mapapagod
tulad ng ilog na hindi
tumitigil sa pag agos
pag ibig di matatapos
tulad ng mundong hindi
tumitigil sa pagikot
pagibig di mapapagod
tulad ng ilog na hindi
tumitigil sa pag agos
pag ibig 'di matatapos

right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleachedblond tramp
and she's probably getting frisky
right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she
can't shoot whiskey
right now he's probably up behind her with a poolstick showing her how to shoot a combo
and he don't know
that i dug my key into the side of his pretty little soupedup fourwheel drive
carved my name into his leather seat
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all tires
and maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
right now she's probably up singing some
whitetrash version of shania kareoke
right now she's probably saying "i'm drunk"
and he's a thinking that he's gonna lucky
right now he's probably dabbing on dollars worth of that bathroom polo
and he don't know
that i dug my key into the side of his pretty little soupedup fourwheel drive
carved my name into his leather seat
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all tires
and maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
i might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
cause the next time that he cheats
oh you know it won't be on me
ohhnot on me
i dug my key into the side of his pretty little soupedup fourwheel drive
carved my name into his leather seat

the little lord jesus lay down his sweet head
the stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay
the little lord jesus asleep on the hay
the cattle are lowing the baby awakes
but little lord jesus no crying he makes
i love thee lord jesus look down from the sky
and stay by my cradle till morning is nigh'
be near me lord jesus i ask thee to stay
close by me for ever and love me i pray
bless all the dear children in thy tender care
and take us to heaven to live with thee there
i heard the bells on christmas day
their old familiar carols play
and mild and sweet their songs repeat
of peace on earth good will to men
and the bells are ringing
like a choir they're singing
in my heart i hear them
peace on earth good will to men
there is no peace on earth i said
for hate is strong and mocks the song
of peace on earth good will to men
but the bells are ringing peace on earth
like a choir singing peace on earth
does anybody hear them peace
peace on earth good will to men
then rang the bells more loud and deep
god is not dead nor doth he sleep peace on earth peace on earth
the wrong shall fail the right prevail
with peace on earth good will to men
then ringing singing on its way
the world revolved from night to day
a voice a chime a chant sublime
of peace on earth good will to men
and the bells they're ringing peace on earth
like a choir they're singing peace on earth
and with our hearts we'll hear them peace
peace on earth good will to men
do you hear the bells they're ringing peace on earth
the life the angels singing peace on earth
open up your heart and hear them peace
peace on earth good will to men
peace on earth peace on earth
peace on earth good will to men

i was sure by nowgod that you would have reached down
and wiped our tears away
stepped in and saved the day
but once again i say amen
and it's still raining
as the thunder rolls
i barely hear you whisper through the rain
"i'm with you"
and as your mercy falls
i raise my hands and praise
the god who gives and takes away
and i'll praise you in this storm
and i will lift my hands
for you are who you are
no matter where i am
and every tear i've cried
you hold in your hand
you never left my side
and though my heart is torn
i will praise you in this storm
i remember when i stumbled in the wind
you heard my cry to you
and raised me up again
my strength is almost gone how can i carry on
if i can't find you
and as the thunder rolls
i barely hear you whisper through the rain
"i'm with you"
and as your mercy falls
i raise my hands and praise
the god who gives and takes away
and i'll praise you in this storm
and i will lift my hands
for you are who you are
no matter where i am
and every tear i've cried
you hold in your hand
you never left my side
and though my heart is torn
i will praise you in this storm
i lift my eyes onto the hills
where does my help come from
my help comes from the lord the maker of heaven and earth
i lift my eyes onto the hills
where does my help come from
my help comes from the lord the maker of heaven and earth
and i'll praise you in this storm
and i will lift my hands
for you are who you are
no matter where i am
and every tear i've cried
you hold in your hand
you never left my side
and though my heart is torn
i will praise you in this storm
and though my heart is torn
i will praise you in this storm
who am i that the lord of all the earth
would care to know my name would care to feel my hurt
who am i that the bright and morning star
would choose to light the way of my ever wondering heart
not because of who i am but because of what you've done
not because of what i've done but because of who you are
i am a flower quickly fading here today and gone tomorrow
a wave tossed in the ocean a vapor in the wind
still you hear me when i'm calling lord you catch me when i'm falling
and you've told me who i am i am yours
who am i that the eyes that see my sin
would look on me with love and watch me rise again
who am i that the voice that calmed the sea
would call out through the rain and calm the storm in me
not because of who i am but because of what you've done
not because of what i've done but because of who you are
i am a flower quickly fading here today and gone tomorrow
a wave tossed in the ocean a vapor in the wind
still you hear me when i'm calling lord you catch me when i'm falling

and i will replace you
you can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
it longs to kill you
are you willing to die
the coldest blood runs through my veins
try to hide your hand
forget how to feel forget how to feel
life is gone with just a spin of the wheel spin of the wheel
arm yourself because noone else here will save you
the odds will betray you
and i will replace you
you can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
it longs to kill you
are you ready to die
the coldest blood runs through my veins
you know my name

amazing grace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now i'm found
was blind but now i see
’twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed
my chains are gone i've been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace
the lord has promised good to me
his word my hope secures
he will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures
my chains are gone i've been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace
my chains are gone i've been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace
the earth shall soon dissolve like snow
the sun forbear to shine
but god who called me here below
will be forever mine
will be forever mine
you are forever mine

i am beautiful no matter what they say
words can't bring me down
i am beautiful in every single way
words won't bring me down
so don't you bring me down today
to all your friends you're delirious

seems like it was yesterday when i saw your face
you told me how proud you were but i walked away
if only i knew what i know today
ooooooo
i would take the pain away
thank you for all you've done
forgive all your mistakes
there's nothing i wouldn't do
to hear your voice again
sometimes i wanna call you
but i know you won't be there
woah i'm sorry for blaming you
for everything i couldn't do
and i hurt myself by hurting you
some days i feel broke inside but i won't admit
sometimes i just wanna hide cause it's you i miss
and it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this
oooooo
would you tell me i was wrong
would you help me understand
are you looking down upon me
are you proud of who i am
there's nothing i wouldn't do
to have just one more chance
to look into your eyes
and see you looking back
woah i'm sorry for blaming you
for everything i just couldn't do
and i hurt myself for hurting you
if i had just one more day
i would tell you how much that i've missed you since you've been away
and oh it's dangerous and so out of line
to try and turn back time
woah i'm sorry for blaming you
for everything i just couldn't do
and i hurt myself for hurting you
by hurting you
i wish i could do better by you 'cause that's what you deserve
you sacrifice so much of your life in order for this to work
while i'm out chasin' my own dreams
sailin' around the world

when you cry a piece of my heart dies knowing i may have been the cause
if you were to leave fulfill someone else's dreams i think i might totally
be lost

and the hardest part
was letting go not taking part
was the hardest pa rt
and the strangest thing
was waiting for that bell to ring
it was the strangest start
i could feel it go down
bittersweet i could taste in my mouth
silver lining the cloud
oh and ii
and the hardest part
was letting go not taking part
you really broke my heart
and i tried to sing
but i couldn't think of anything
and that was the hardest part
i could feel it go down
you left the sweetest taste in my mouth
you're silver lining the clouds
oh and ii
oh and ii
everything i know is wrong
everything i do it's just comes undone
and everything is torn apart
oh and it's the hardest part

you don't know how lovely you are
i had to find you tell you i need you
tell you i'll set you apart
tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
oh let's go back to the start
running in circles coming up tails
heads on a science apart
nobody said it was easy
it's such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be this hard
oh take me back to the start
i was just guessing at numbers and figures
pulling the puzzles apart
questions of science science and progress
they must speak as loud as my heart
tell me you love me come back and haunt me
i wanna rush to the start
running in circles chasing tails
comin' back as we are
nobody said it was easy
oh it's such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be so hard
i'm going back to the start



steal my heart
and hold my tongue
i feel my time
my time has come
let me in
unlock the door
i ne ver felt this way before
and the wheels just keep on turning
the drummer begins to drum
i don't know which way i'm going
i don't know which way i've come
hold my head
inside your hands
i need someone
who understands
i need someone
someone who hears
for you i've waited all these years
for you i'd wait
'til kingdom come
until my day
my day is done
and say you'll come
and set me free
just say you'll wait
you'll wait for me
in your tears
and in your blood
in your fire
and in your flood
i hear you laugh
i heard you sing
i wouldn't change a single thing
and the wheels just keep on turning
the drummer begins to drum
i don't know which way i'm going
i don't know which way i've come
for you i'd wait
'til kingdom come
until my day
my day is done
and say you'll come
and set me free
just say you'll wait
you'll wait for me
just say you'll wait
you'll wait for me
oh no i see
a spider web is tangled up with me
and i lost my head
and thought of all the stupid things i’d said
oh no what’s this
a spider web and i’m caught in the middle
so i turned to run and
thought of all the stupid things i’d done
and ah i never meant to cause you trouble
ah i never meant to do you wrong
ah well if i ever caused you trouble
then oh no i never meant to do you harm
oh no i see
a spider web and it’s me in the middle
so i twist and turn
but here am i in my little bubble
singing out ah i never meant to cause you trouble
ah i never meant to do you wrong
and ah well if i ever caused you trouble
then oh no i never meant to do you harm
and they spun a web for me
they spun a web for me
and they spun a web for me
i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
"now the old king is dead long live the king"
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
once you go there was never never an honest word
that was when i ruled the world
it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what i'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever want to be king
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
i know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
ohhhhh ohhh ohhh
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
i know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
oooooh oooooh oooooh

it's the wrong kind of place
to be thinking of you

it's a small crime
and i've got no excuse

there's still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
there's still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
it's still a little hard to say what's going on
there's still a little bit of your ghost your witness
there's still a little bit of your face i haven't kissed
you step a little closer each day that i can't say what's going on
stones taught me to fly
love taught me to lie
life taught me to die
so it's not hard to fall when you float like a cannonball
there's still a little bit of your song in my ear
there's still a little bit of your words i long to hear
you step a little closer to me so close that i can't see what's going on
stones taught me to fly
love taught me to lie
life taught me to die
so it's not hard to fall when you float like a cannon
stones taught me to fly
love taught me to cry
so come on courage teach me to be shy
cause it's not hard to fall and i don't wanna scare her
it's not hard to fall and i don't wanna lose
it's not hard to grow when you know that you just don't know
and so it is
just like you said it would be
life goes easy on me
most of the time
and so it is
the shorter story
no love no glory
no hero in her sky
i can't take my eyes off of you
i can't take my eyes off you
i can't take my eyes off of you
i can't take my eyes off you
i can't take my eyes off you
i can't take my eyes
and so it is
just like you said it should be
we'll both forget the breeze
most of the time
and so it is
the colder water
the blower's daughter
the pupil in denial
i can't take my eyes off of you
i can't take my eyes off you
i can't take my eyes off of you
i can't take my eyes off you
i can't take my eyes off you
i can't take my eyes
oooooooooohh
did i say that i loathe you
did i say that i want to
leave it all behind
i can't take my mind off of you
i can't take my mind off you
i can't take my mind off of you
i can't take my mind off you
i can't take my mind off you
i can't take my mind
my mindmy mind
or
where is the moment when we need it the most
you kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
they tell me your blue sky's faded to grey
the tell me your passion's gone away
and i don't need no carrying on
stand in line just to hit a new low
you're faking a smile with the coffee you go
you tell me your life's been way off line
you're falling to pieces everytime
and i don't need no carrying on
cause you had a bad day
you're taking one down
you sing a sad song just to turn it around
you say you don't know
you tell me don't lie
you work at a smile and you go for a ride
you had a bad day
the camera don't lie
you're coming back down and you really don't mind
you had a bad day
you had a bad day
well you need a blue sky holiday
the point is they laugh at what you say
and i don't need no carrying on
cause you had a bad day
you're taking one down
you sing a sad song just to turn it around
you say you don't know
you tell me don't lie
you work at a smile and you go for a ride
you had a bad day
the camera don't lie
you're coming back down and you really don't mind
you had a bad day
sometimes the system goes on the blink
and the whole thing it turns out wrong
you might not make it back and you know
that you could be well oh that strong
well i'm not wrong
so where is the passion when you need it the most
you kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
cause you had a bad day
you're taking one down
you sing a sad song just to turn it around
you say you don't know
you tell me don't lie
you work at a smile and you go for a ride
you had a bad day
it seem what you like
and how does it feel for one more time

bearing all my sin and shame

he is jealous for me
loves like a hurricane i am a tree
bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy
when all of a sudden
i am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
and i realize just how beautiful you are
and how great your affections are for me
and oh how he loves us oh
oh how he loves us
how he loves us all
he is jealous for me
loves like a hurricane i am a tree
bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy
when all of a sudden
i am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
and i realize just how beautiful you are
and how great your affections are for me
he loves us
oh how he loves us
oh how he loves us
oh how he loves
we are his portion and he is our prize
drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes
if grace is an ocean we’re all sinking
so heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss
and my heart turns violently inside of my chest
i don’t have time to maintain these regrets
when i think about the way…
yeah he loves us
oh how he loves us
oh how he loves us
oh how he loves
yeah he loves us
oh how he loves us
oh how he loves us
oh how he loves us oh
i will follow you into the dark
just our hands clasped so tight
waiting for the hint of a spark
if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
illuminate the "no's" on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
i got my knuckles bruised
by a lady in black
so i never went back
if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
illuminate the "no's" on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
you and me have seen everything to see
from bangkok to calgary
and the soles of your shoes
are all worn down the time for sleep is now
but it's nothing to cry about
because we'll hold each other soon in the blackest of rooms
if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
illuminate the "no's" on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
then i will follow you into the dark
i've watched you change
into a fly
i looked away
you were on fire
i watched a change
in you
it's like you never
had wings
now you feel
so alive

climbed a mountain then i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow covered hills

the landslide will bring you down

when i get to warwick avenue
meet me by the entrance of the tube
we can talk things over a little time
promise me you won't step out of line
when i get to warwick avenue
please drop the past and be true
don't think we're okay just because i'm here
you hurt me bad but i won't shed a tear
i'm leaving you for the last time baby
you think you're loving but you don't love me
i've been confused outta my mind lately
you think you're loving but i want to be free baby you've hurt me
when i get to warwick avenue
we'll spend an hour but no more than two
our only chance to speak once more
i showed you the answers now here's the door
when i get to warwick avenue
i'll tell baby there we're through
i'm leaving you for the last time baby
you think you're loving but you don't love me
and i've been confused outta my mind lately
you think you're loving but you don't love me
i want to be free baby you've hurt me
all the days spent together i wished for better
but i didn't want the train to come
now it's departed i'm broken hearted
seems like we never started
all those days spent together when i wished for better
and i didn't want the train to cooooome
you think you're loving but you don't love me
i want to be free baby you've hurt me
you don't love me i want to be free
baby you've hurt me
on bended knee is no way to be free
lifting up an empty cup i ask silently
all my destinations will accept the one that's me
so i can breathe
circles they grow and they swallow people whole
half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never know
a mind full of questions and a teacher in my soul
and so it goes
don't come closer or i'll have to go
holding me like gravity are places that pull
if ever there was someone to keep me at home
it would be you
everyone i come across in cages they bought
they think of me and my wandering but i'm never what they thought
i've got my indignation but i'm pure in all my thoughts
i'm alive
wind in my hair i feel part of everywhere
underneath my being is a road that disappeared
late at night i hear the trees they're singing with the dead
overhead
leave it to me as i find a way to be
consider me a satellite forever orbiting
i knew all the rules but the rules did not know me
guaranteed
when i walk beside her
i am the better man
when i look to leave her
i always stagger back again
once i built an ivory tower
so i could worship from above
when i climb down to be set free
she took me in again
there's a big
a big hard sun
beatin' on the big people
in the big hard world
when she comes to greet me
she is mercy at my feet
when i see her pin her charm
she just throws it back at me
once i dug an early grave
to find a better land
she just smiled and laughed at me
and took her bruise back again
there's a big
a big hard sun
beatin' on the big people
in the big hard world
there's a big
a big hard sun
beatin' on the big people
in the big hard world
when i go to cross that river
she is comfort by my side
when i try to understand
she just opens up her hands
there's a big
a big hard sun
beatin' on the big people
in the big hard world
once i stood to lose her
when i saw what i had done
bound down and flew away the hours
of her garden and her sun
so i tried to warn her
i turned to see her weep
days and nights
and it's still coming down on me
there's a big
a big hard sun
beatin' on the big people
in the big hard world
there's a big
a big hard sun
beatin' on the big people
in the big hard world
oh it's a mystery to me
we have a greed with which we have agreed
and you think you have to want more than you need
until you have it all you won't be free
society you're a crazy breed
hope you're not lonely without me
when you want more than you have you think you need
and when you think more than you want your thoughts begin to bleed
i think i need to find a bigger place
'cause when you have more than you think you need more space
society you're a crazy breed
hope you're not lonely without me
society crazy indeed
hope you're not lonely without me

there's those thinking moreorless less is more

ae

i never thought that i could be so bold
to even say these thoughts aloud
i see you with your man your eyes just shine
while he stands tall and walking proud
that look you give that guy i wanna see
looking right at me
if i could be that guy instead of me
i'd never let you down
it always seems like you're going somewhere
better than you've been before
while i go to sleep and i dream all night
of you knocking at my door
that look you give that guy i wanna see
looking right at me
if i could be that guy instead of me
i'd be all i can be i'd be all i can be
i'm nothing like what i'd like to be
i'm nothing much i know it's true
i lack the style and the pedigree
and my chances are so few
that look you give that guy i wanna see
looking right at me
if i could be that guy instead of me
i'd give you all i got
i never thought that i could be so bold
to even say these thoughts aloud
but if let's say it won't work out
you know where i can be found
that look you give that guy i wanna see
looking right at me
if i could be that guy instead of me
i'd never let you down i'd never let you down
ein hotdog unten am hafen
vorm einschlafen schnell noch ein bier
dem feind einen tritt in die rippen
und ein paar kippen für hinterher
ein date mit dem dalai lama
und ein apfelsaft morgens um zwei
und eine halbautomatische waffe ist immer dabei
schön wenn man liebt
was mutter natur einem gibt
was kann ich dafür dass du mich nicht vergisst
ein geselliges tier ist das schwein
und das stachelschwein lieber allein
ohne dich will ich nicht
mit dir kann ich nicht sein
räucherstäbchen und wildreis
und abende auf dem balkon
in eppendorf ist morgen flohmarkt
und jeder nach seiner facon
ein date mit dem dalai lama
und ein griff ins kosmetikregal
und wenn's im rücken mal weh tut wird jede bewegung zur qual
schön wenn man liebt
was mutter natur einem gibt
was kann ich dafür dass du mich nicht vergisst
ein geselliges tier ist das schwein
und das stachelschwein lieber allein
ohne dich will ich nicht
mit dir kann ich nicht sein
eine parkbank in planten und blomen
und der mond über altona
ein sohn der bald mal ins bett muss
und trockene blumen im haar
ein date mit dem dalai lama
und ein klimpern auf dem klavier
und zum abschied ein bisschen gefummel hinter der tür
schön wenn man liebt
was mutter natur einem gibt
was kann ich dafür dass du mich nicht vergisst
ein geselliges tier ist das schwein
und das stachelschwein lieber allein
ohne dich will ich nicht
mit dir kann ich nicht sein
ohne dich will ich nicht
mit dir kann ich nicht sein
haven't laughed this hard in a long time
i better stop now before i start crying
go off to sleep in the sunshine
i don't wanna see the day when it's dying
she's a sight to see sight to see
she's a good to me good to me
but i'm already somebody's baby
she's a pretty thing pretty thing
and she knows everything everything
but i'm already somebody's baby
you don't deserve to be lonely
but those drugs you got won't make you feel better
pretty soon you'll find it's the only
little part of your life you're keeping together
i'm nice to you nice to you
i could make it through make it through
but you're already somebody's baby
i could make you smile make you smile
if you stayed a while stayed a while
but how long will you stay with me baby
because your candle burns too bright
well i almost forgot it was twilight
even if i think that you are right
well i'm tired of being down i got no fight
you're wonderful wonderful
when it's beautiful beautiful
but i'm already somebody's baby
and if i went with you went with you
i'd disapoint you too disappoint you too
but i'm already somebody's baby
already somebody's baby

the a string for bb here is optional
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words won't come out
he's choking how everybody's joking now
the clock's run out times up over blaoh
snap back to reality oh there goes gravity
oh there goes rabbit he choked he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy no he won't have it he knows
his whole back's to these ropes it don't matter he's dope
he knows that but he's broke he's so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to his mobile home that's when it's
back to the lab again yo
this whole rhapsody better go capture this moment
and hope it don't pass him
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime
his soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking make me king
as we move toward a new world order a normal life is boring
but superstardom's close to post mortem
it only grows harder homie grows hotter
he blows it's all over these hoes is all on him
coast to coast shows he's known as the globetrotter lonely roads
god only knows he's grown farther from home he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
these hoes don't want him no more he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose dove and sold nada so the soap opera is told it unfolds
i suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
da da dum da dum da da da
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
no more games i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
i was playing in the beginning the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhyming and stepped writing the next cypher
best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the fact
that i can't get by with my to
and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
cause man these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and it's no movie there's no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
trying to feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
caught up between being a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama's screaming on and too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point i'm like a snail
i've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfucking option failure's not
mom i love you but this trailer's got to go
i cannot grow old in 'salem's lot so here i go it's my shot
feet fail me not this may be the only opportunity that i got
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better

if you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to but you could've signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother man he's only six years old
we waited in the blistering cold for you
for four hours and you just said no
that's pretty sy man you're like his fing idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad though i just don't like being lied to
remember when we met in denver you said if i write you
you would write back see i'm just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when i have a sy day i drift away and put em on
cause i don't really got s else so that s helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
its like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everthing you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous because i talk about you
but she don't know you like i know you slim no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me man i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours stan ps

i know you got my last two letters
i wrote the addresses on them perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sending you i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now i'm doin' on the freeway
hey slim i drank a fifth of vodka dare me to drive
you know that song by phil collins in the air of the night
about that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't but phil saw it all then at a show he found him
that's kinda how this is you could've rescued me from drowning
now it's too late i'm on a downers now i'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off my wall
i love you slim we could've been together think about it
you ruined it now i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
see slim shut up b i'm trying to talk
hey slim that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
but i didn't slit her throat i just tied her up see i ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more then she'll die too
well gotta go i'm almost under the bridge now
oh s i forgot how am i supposed to send this s out

got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad

dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i've just been busy
you say your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she
look i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother
i wrote it on this starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show i must've missed you
don't think i did that s intentionally just to dis you
but what's that s you said about you like to cut your wrists too
i say that s just clownin' dog
c'mon how fed up is you
you got some issues stan i think you need some counseling
to keep your a from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
and what's this s about us meant to be together
that type of s will make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter i hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little i'm glad that i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy s
i seen this one s on the news a couple of weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in his trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape didn't say who it was to
come to think about it his name was it was you
damn
we can remember swimming in december
heading for the city lights in
we share in each other
nearer than father
the scent of a lemon drips from your eyes
we are the people that rule the world
a force running in every boy and girl
all rejoicing in the world
take me now
we can try
we lived an adventure
love in the summer
followed the sun till night
reminiscing other times of life
the feeling was stronger
the shock hit eleven
got lost in your eyes
i can’t do well when i think you’re gonna leave me but i know i try
are you gonna leave me now
can’t you be believing now
can you remember and humanize
it was still where we’d energized
lie in the sand and visualize like its again
we are the people that rule the world
a force running in every boy and girl
all rejoicing in the world
take me now
we can try
i can’t do well when i think you’re gonna leave me but i know i try
are you gonna leave me now
can’t you be believing now
i know everything about you
you know everything about me
know everything about us
i can’t do well when i think you’re gonna leave me but i know i try
are you gonna leave me now
can’t you be believing now
chords used i think are g em c and d

how can you see into my eyes like open doors
leading you down into my core where i've become so numb
without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
until you find it there and lead it back home
wake me up wake me up inside
i can't wake up wake me up inside
save me call my name and save me from the dark
wake me up bid my blood to run
i can't wake up before i come undone
save me save me from the nothing i've become
now that i know what i'm without
breathe into me and make me real
wake me up wake me up inside
i can't wake up wake me up inside
save me call my name and save me from the dark
wake me up bid my blood to run
i can't wake up before i come undone
save me save me from the nothing i've become
bring me to life
bring me to life
frozen inside without your touch
without your love darling
only you are the life among the dead
all this time i can't believe i couldn't see
kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
i've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
got to open my eyes to everything
without a thought without a voice without a soul
don't let me die here
there must be something more
bring me to life
wake me up wake me up inside
i can't wake up wake me up inside
save me call my name and save me from the dark
wake me up bid my blood to run
i can't wake up before i come undone
save me save me from the nothing i've become
bring me to life
bring me to life i've been living a lie there's nothing inside
bring me to life


i'm so tired of being here
suppressed by all of my childish fears
and if you have to leave i wish that you could just leave
'cause your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone
these wounds won't seem to heal
this pain is just too real
there's just too much that time cannot erase
when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears
when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears
i held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me

you used to captivate me by your resonating light
but now i'm bound by the life you left behind
your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
these wounds won't seem to heal
this pain is just too real
there's just too much that time cannot erase
when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears
when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears
i held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me
i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
but though you're still with me i've been alone all along
when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears
when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears
i held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me

am i more than you bargained for yet
i've been dying to tell you anything
you want to hear cause that's just who i am this week
lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
i'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
drop a heart break a name
we're always sleepin' in and we're sleepin' for the wrong team
we're going down down in an earlier round
and sugar we're going down swinging
i'll be your number one with a bullet
a loaded god complex cock it and pull it
we're going down down in an earlier round
and sugar we're going down swinging
i'll be your number one with a bullet
a loaded god complex cock it and pull it
is this more than you bargained for yet
oh don't mind me i'm watching you two from the closet
wishing to be the friction in your jeans
isn't it messed up how i'm just dying to be him
i'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
drop a heart break a name
we're always sleepin' in and we're sleepin' for the wrong team
we're going down down in an earlier round
and sugar we're going down swinging
i'll be your number one with a bullet
a loaded god complex cock it and pull it
we're going down down in an earlier round
and sugar we're going down swinging
i'll be your number one with a bullet
a loaded god complex cock it and pull it
down down in an earlier round and sugar we're going down swinging
i'll be your number one with a bullet a loaded god complex cock it and pull it
we're going down down in an earlier round and sugar we're going down swinging
i'll be your number one with a bullet a loaded god complex cock it and pull it
we're going down down down down
we're going down down down down
we're going down down down down
a loaded god complex cock it and pull it
we're going down down in an earlier round
and sugar we're going down swinging
i'll be your number one with a bullet
a loaded god complex cock it and pull it

da da da da
the smell of your skin lingers on me now
your probably on your flight back to your home town
i need some shelter of my own protection baby
to be with myself and center clarity peace serenity
i hope you know i hope you know
that this has nothing to do with you
it's personal myself and i
we've got some straightenin' out to do
and i'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
but ive got to get a move on with my life
its time to be a big girl now and big girls don't cry
don't cry don't cry don't cry
the path that i'm walking i must go alone
i must take the baby steps 'til i'm full grown full grown
fairytales don't always have a happy ending do they
and i foresee the dark ahead if i stay
i hope you know i hope you know
that this has nothing to do with you
it's personal myself and i
we've got some straightenin' out to do
and i'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
but ive got to get a move on with my life
its time to be a big girl now and big girls don't cry
like the little schoolmate in the school yard
we'll play jacks and uno cards
i'll be your best friend and you'll be mine valentine
yes you can hold my hand if you want to
'cause i want to hold yours too
we'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
but it's time for me to go home
it's getting late dark outside
i need to be with myself and center clarity peace serenity
i hope you know i hope you know
that this has nothing to do with you
it's personal myself and i
we've got some straightenin' out to do
and i'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
but ive got to get a move on with my life
its time to be a big girl now and big girls don't cry
don't cry don't cry don't cry
i can't stand to fly
i'm not that naive
i'm just out to find
the better part of me
i'm more than a bird i'm more than a plane
i'm more than some pretty face beside a train
it's not easy to be me
i wish that i could cry
fall upon my knees
find a way to lie
'bout a home i'll never see
it may sound absurd but don't be naive
even heroes have the right to bleed
i may be disturbed but won't you concede
even heroes have the right to dream
and it's not easy to be me
up up and away away from me
well it's alright
you can all sleep sound tonight
i'm not crazy or anything
i can't stand to fly
i'm not that naive
men weren't meant to ride
with clouds between their knees
i'm only a man in a silly red sheet
digging for kryptonite on this oneway street
only a man in a funny red sheet
looking for special things inside of me
inside of me inside of me
inside of me inside of me
i'm only a man in a funny red sheet
i'm only a man looking for a dream
i'm only a man in a funny red sheet
it's not easy ooh hoo hoo
it's not easy to be me
lie down with me my dear
lie dooooown
lie down stormy night
tell nobooody
my brother where do you intend to go tonight
i heard that you missed your connecting flight
to the blue ridge mountains over near tennessee
you're ever welcome with me any time you like
let's drive to the countryside leave behind some greeneyed lookalikes
so no one gets worried no
so no one gets worried no
but sean don't get careless i'm sure it'll be fine
i love you i love you oh brother of mine
in the quivering forest where the shivering dog rests
our good grandfather built a wooden nest
and the river got frozen and the home got snowed in
and the yellow moon glowed bright till the morning light
terrible am i child even if you don't mind
in the quivering forest where the shivering dog rests
our good grandfather built a wooden nest
and the river got frozen and the home got snowed in
and the yellow moon glowed bright till the morning light
terrible am i child even if you don't mind no
wanderers this morning came by
where did they go graceful in the morning light
to banner fair
to follow you softly in the cold mountain air
through the forest and down to your grave
where the birds wait and the tall grasses wave
they do not
know you anymore
dear shadow alive and well
how can the body die
you tell me everything anything true
in the town one morning i went
staggering through premonitions of my death
i don't see anybody that dear to me
dear shadow alive and well
how can the body die
you tell me everything anything true
jessie
i don't know what i have done
i'm turning myself into a demon
i don't know what i have done
i'm turning myself into a demon
i was following the i was following the i
i was following the pack all swallowed in their coats
with scarves of red tied 'round their throats
to keep their little heads
from fallin' in the snow
and i turn 'round and there you go
and michael you would fall
and turn the white snow red as strawberries in the summertime
i was following the pack all swallowed in their coats
with scarves of red tied 'round their throats
to keep their little heads
from fallin' in the snow

happiness hit her like a train on a track
coming towards her stuck still no turning back
she hid around corners and she hid under beds
she killed it with kisses and from it she fled
with every bubble she sank with her drink
and washed it away down the kitchen sink
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
the horses are coming
so you better run
run fast for your mother run fast for your father
run for your children for your sisters and brothers
leave all your loving your loving behind
you can't carry it with you if you want to survive
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
can you hear the horses
'cause here they come
and i never wanted anything from you
except for everything you had and what was left after that too oh
happiness hit her like a bullet in the head
struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
can you hear the horses
'cause here they come
run fast for your mother run fast for your father
run for your children for your sisters and brothers
leave all your loving your loving behind
you can't carry it with you if you want to survive
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
can you hear the horses
'cause here they come
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
the horses are coming
so you better run
sometimes i feel like throwing my hands up in the air
i know i can count on you
sometimes i feel like saying "lord i just don't care"
but you've got the love i need to see me through
sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
and things go wrong no matter what i do
now and then it seems that life is just too much
but you've got the love i need to see me through
when food is gone you are my daily meal
when friends are gone i know my savior's love is real
you got the love
you got the love
you got the love
you got the love
you got the love
you got the love
time after time i think "oh lord what's the use"
time after time i think it's just no good
sooner or later in life the things you love you loose
but you got the love i need to see me through
you got the love
you got the love
and you got the love
you got the love
you got the love
and you got the love
sometimes i feel like throwing my hands up in the air
cause i know i can count on you
sometimes i feel like saying "lord i just don't care"
but you've got the love i need to see me through
i've got another confession to make
i'm your fool
everyone's got their chains to break
holdin' you
were you born to resist or be abused
is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
are you gone and onto someone new
i needed somewhere to hang my head
without your noose
you gave me something that i didn't have
but had no use
i was too weak to give in
too strong to lose
my heart is under arrest again
but i break loose
my head is giving me life or death
but i can't choose
i swear i'll never give in
i refuse
is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you

was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
in fields where they lay keeping their sheep
on a cold winter's night that was so deep
noel noel noel noel
born is the king of isr ael
they looked up and saw a star
shining in the east beyond them far
and to the earth it gave great light
and so it continued both day and night
noel noel noel noel
born is the king of isr ael
so let us all with one accord
sing praises to our heavenly lord
that hath made heaven and earth of nought
and with his blood mankind has bought

all around me are familiar faces
worn out places worn out faces
bright and early for their daily races
going nowhere going nowhere
their tears are filling up their glasses
no expression no expression
hide my head i want to drown my sorrow
no tomorrow no tomorrow
and i find it kinda funny i find it kinda sad
the dreams in which i'm dying are the best i've ever had
i find it hard to tell you i find it hard to take
when people run in circles it's a very very
mad world
mad world
children waiting for the day they feel good
happy birthday happy birthday
made to feel the way that every child should
sit and listen sit and listen
went to school and i was very nervous
no one knew me no one knew me
hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
look right through me look right through me
and i find it kinda funny i find it kinda sad
the dreams in which i'm dying are the best i've ever had
i find it hard to tell you i find it hard to take
when people run in circles it's a very very
mad world
mad world
enlarging your world
mad world
everything is free now

and try to make a little change
down at the bar
or i can get a straight job
i've done it before
i never minded working hard
it's who i'm working for
everything is free now
that's what they say
everything i ever done
i'm going to give it away
someone hit the big score
they figured it out
that we're gonna do it anyway
even if doesn't pay
every day i wake up
hummin' a song
but i don't need to run around
i just stay home
and sing a little love song
my love to myself
if there's something that you want to hear
you can sing it yourself
'cause everything is free now
that what i say
no one's got to listen to
the words in my head
someone hit the big score
and i figured it out
that we're gonna do it anyway
even if doesn't pay
oh me oh my oh look at miss ohio
she's arunning around with her ragtop down
she says i wanna do right but not right now

i don't know you but i want you all the more for that
words fall through me and always fool me and i can't react
games that never amount to more than they're meant will play themselves out
take this sinking boat and point it home we've still got time
raise your hopeful voice you had the choice you've made it now
falling slowly eyes that know me and i can't go back
moods that take me and erase me and i'm painted black
you have suffered enough and warred with yourself it's time that you won
take this sinking boat and point it home we've still got time
raise your hopeful voice you had the choice you've made it now
take this sinking boat and point it home we've still got time
raise your hopeful voice you had the choice you've made it now
falling slowly sing your melody i'll sing along
i remember when i remember i remember when i lost my mind
there was something so pleasant about that place
in so much space
and when you're out there without care
yeah i was out of touch
but it wasn't because i didn't know enough
i just knew too much
does that make me crazy
does that make me crazy
does that make me crazy
possibly
and i hope that you are having the time of your life
but think twice that's my only advice

my heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
and all i remember is thinking i wanna be like them
ever since i was little ever since i was little it looked like fun
and it's no coincidence i've come
and i can die when i'm done
maybe i'm crazy
maybe you're crazy
maybe we're crazy
probably

do you know what's worth fighting for
when it's not worth dying for
does it take you breath away
and you feel yourself suffocating
does the pain weight out the pride
and you look for a place to hide
does someone break your heart inside
you're in ruins
one guns
lay down your arms
give up the fight
one guns
throw up your
arms into the sky
you and i
when you're at the end of the road
and you lost all sense of control
and your thoughts have taken their toll
when your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
your faith walks on broken glass
and the hangover doesn't pass
nothing's ever built to last
you're in ruins
one guns
lay down your arms
give up the fight
one guns
throw up your
arms into the sky
you and i
did you try to live on your own
when you burned down the house and home
did you stand too close to the fire
like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
e||||||||
e||||||||

e|||||
when it's time to live and let die
and you can't get another try
something inside this heart has died
you're in ruins
one guns
lay down your arms
give up the fight
one guns
throw up your
arms into the sky
one guns
lay down your arms
give up the fight

i walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams
where the city sleeps and i'm the only one and i walk alone
i walk alone i walk alone

my shadow's the only one that walks beside me
my shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me

that divides me somewhere in my mind
on the border line of the edge
and where i walk alone

and i walk alone

coming down like an armageddon flame hey
the shame the ones who died without a name
hear the dogs howling out of key
to a hymn called "faith and misery" hey
and bleed the company lost the war today
i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
this is the dawning of the rest of our lives
on holiday

i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies

i'm the son of rage and love
the jesus of suburbia
from the bible of none of the above
on a steady diet of
soda pop and ritalin
no one ever died for my
sins in hell as far as i can tell
at least the ones i've gotten away with
and there's nothing wrong with me
this is how i'm supposed to be
in a land of makebelieve
get my television fix
sitting on my crucifix
the living room or my private womb
while the moms and brads are away
to fall in love and fall in debt
to alcohol and cigarettes
and mary jane to keep me insane
and doing someone else's cocaine
and there's nothing wrong with me
this is how i'm supposed to be
in a land of makebelieve
at the center of the earth
in the parking lot
of the where i was taught
the motto was just a lie
it says "home is where your heart is"
but what a shame
cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
it's beating out of time
city of the dead
at the end of another lost highway
signs misleading to nowhere
city of the damned
lost children with dirty faces today
no one really seems to care
i read the graffiti
in the bathroom stall
like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
and so it seemed to confess
it didn't say much
but it only confirmed
that the center of the earth is the end of the world
and i could really care less
city of the dead
at the end of another lost highway
signs misleading to nowhere
city of the damned
lost children with dirty faces today
no one really seems to care
i don't care if you don't
i don't care if you don't
i don't care if you don't care
i don’t care
everyone is so full of shit
born and raised by hypocrites
hearts recycled but never saved
from the cradle to the grave
we are the kids of war and peace
from anaheim to the middle east
we are the stories and disciples
of the jesus of suburbia
land of makebelieve
and it don't believe in me
land of makebelieve
and i don't believe
and i don’t care
and i don’t care
dearly beloved are you listening
i can’t remember a word that you were saying
are we demented or am i disturbed
the space that's in between insane and insecure
oh therapy can you please fill the void
am i retarded or am i just overjoyed
nobody's perfect and i stand accused
for lack of a better word and that's my best excuse
to live and not to breathe
is to die in tragedy
to run to run away
to find what you believe
and i leave be hind
this hurricane of fucking lies
i lost my faith to this
this town that don't exist
so i run i run away
to the light of masochist
and i leave be hind
this hurricane of fucking lies
and i walked this line
a million and one fucking times but not this time
i don't feel any shame
i won’t apologize
when there ain't nowhere you can go
running away from pain
when you've been victimized
tales from another broken
home
you’re leaving
you’re leaving
you’re leaving
ah you’re leaving home
i text a postcard sent to you
did it go through
sending all my love to you
you are the moonlight of my life every night
giving all my love to you
my beating heart belongs to you
i walked for miles 'til i found you
i'm here to honor you
if i lose everything in the fire
i'm sending all my love to you
with every breath that i am worth
here on earth
i'm sending all my love to you
so if you dare to second guess
you can rest
assured that all my love's for you
my beating heart belongs to you
i walked for miles 'til i found you
i'm here to honor you
if i lose everything in the fire
i'm sending all my love to you
my beating heart belongs to you
i walked for miles 'til i found you
i'm here to honor you
if i lose everything in the fire
did i ever make it through
summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
like my father's come to pass
seven years has gone so fast
wake me up when september ends
here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are
as my memory rests
but never forgets what i lost
wake me up when september ends
summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
ring out the bells again
like we did when spring began
wake me up when september ends
here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are
as my memory rests
but never forgets what i lost
wake me up when september ends
summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
like my father's come to pass
twenty years has gone so fast
wake me up when september ends
wake me up when september ends
wake me up when september ends
you were a phonograph i was a kid
i sat with an ear close just listening
i was there when the rain tapped her way down your face
you were a miracle i was just holdin your space
well time has a way of throwing it all in your face
the past she is haunted the future is laced
heartbreak ya know drives a big black car
swear i was in the back seat just minding my own
and through the glass the corn crows come like rain
they wont stay they wont stay for
too long now
this could be all that we know
of love and all
well you were a dancer i was a rag
the song in my head well was all that i had
hope was a letter i never could send
love was a country we couldn't defend
and through the carnival we watch them go round and round
all we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns ohhhhhhh
well you were a magazine i was a plain jane
just walking the sidewalks all covered in rain
love to just get into one of your stories
just me and all of my plain jane glory
just me and all of my plain jane glory
heyayayayay
ohhohohohoh
heyayayayay
heyay
heyay

remember when our songs were just like prayers
like gospel hymns that you called in the air
come down come down sweet reverence
unto my simple house and ringand ring
ring like silver ring like gold
ring out those ghosts on the ohio
ring like clear day wedding bells
were we the belly of the beast or the sword that fellwe'll never tell
come to me clear and cold on some sea
watch the world spinning waveslike machines
now ive been crazy couldn't you tell
i threw stones at the stars but the whole sky fell
now i'm covered up in straw belly up on the table
well and drank and sang and passed in the stable
that tall grass grows high and brown
well i dragged you straight in the muddy ground
and you sent me back to where i roam
well i cursed and i cried but now i knownow i know
and i ran back to that hollow again
the moon was just a sliver back then
and i ached for my heart like some tin man
when it came oh it beat and it boiled and it rang oh it's ringing
ring like crazy ring like hell
turn me back into that wild haired gale
ring like silver ring like gold
turn these diamonds straight back into coal
turn these diamonds straight back into coal
a thousand times i’ve failed
still your mercy remains
and should i stumble again
i’m caught in your grace
everlasting
your light will shine when all else fades
never ending
your glory goes beyond all fame
your will above all else
my purpose remains
the art of losing myself
in bringing you praise
everlasting
your light will shine when all else fades
never ending
your glory goes beyond all fame
in my heart and my soul
lord i give you control
consume me from the inside out
lord let justice and praise
become my embrace
to love you from the inside out repeat
everlasting
your light will shine when all else fades
never ending
your glory goes beyond all fame
and the cry of my heart
is to bring you praise
from the inside out
lord my soul cries out
cries out everlasting
your light will shine when all else fades
never ending
your glory goes beyond all fame
and the cry of my heart
is to bring you praise
from the inside out
lord my soul cries out
from the inside out
lord my soul cries out lord
i see the king of glory
coming on the clouds with fire
the whole earth shakes
the whole earth shakes
i see his love and mercy
washing over all our sin
the people sing
the people sing
ho sanna ho san na
hosanna in the highest

rising up to take their place
with selfless faith with selfless faith
i see a near revival
stirring as we pray and seek

hosanna in the high est

open up my eyes to the things unseen

break my heart for what breaks yours

where are we what the hell is going on
the dust has only just begun to form
crop circles in the carpet sinking feeling
spin me around again and rub my eyes
this can't be happening
when busy streets a mess with people would stop to hold their heads heavy
hide and seek
trains and sewing machines
all those years they were here first
oily marks appear on walls
where pleasure moments hung before
the takeover the sweeping insensitivity of this
still life
hide and seek
trains and sewing machines oh you won't catch me around here
blood and tears they were here first
mm what you say
oh that you only meant well well of course you did
mm what you say
mm that it's all for the best of course it is
mm what you say
that it's just what we need you decided this
mm what you say
what did she say

we might not have any money
but we've got our love to pay the bills
maybe i think you're cute and funny
maybe i wanna do what bunnies do with you
if you know what i mean
oh let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the south of france
let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
and teach them how to dance
let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
making everybody look like ants
from way up there you and i you and i

and you might be a little bit bruised
but baby how we spoon like no one else
so i will help you read those books
if you will soothe my worried looks

making everybody look like ants
from way up there you and i you and i
i was a quick wet boy
diving too deep for coins
all of your street light eyes
wide on my plastic toys
and when the cops closed the fair
i cut my long baby hair
stole me a dogeared map
and called for you everywhere
have i found you
flightless bird jealous weeping
or lost you
american mouth
big pill looming
now i’m a fat house cat
nursing my sore blunt tongue
watching the warm poison rats
curl through the wide fence cracks
pissing on magazine
photos those fishing lures
thrown in the cold and clean
blood of christ mountain stream
have i found you
flightless bird grounded bleeding
or lost you
american mouth
big pill stuck going down
you are alpha and omega
we worship you our lord
you are worthy to be praised
you are alpha and omega
we worship you our lord
you are worthy to be praised
we give you all the glory

well can't you see that it's just rainin'
there ain't no need to go outside
but baby you hardly even notice
when i try to show you
this song is meant to keep you
from doin' what you're supposed to
wakin' up too early
maybe we could sleep in
make you banana pancakes
pretend like it's the weekend now
and we could pretend it all the time
can't you see that it's just rainin'
there ain't no need to go outside
but just maybe laka ukulele
mama made a baby
really don't mind to practice
because you're my little lady
lady lady love me
'cause i love to lay here lazy
we could close the curtains
pretend like there's no world outside
and we could pretend it all the time
can't you see that it's just rainin'
there ain't no need to go outside
ain't no need ain't no need
mmmm mmmm
can't you see can't you see
rain all day and i don't mind
but the telephone's singing ringing
it's too early don't pick it up we don't need to
we got everything we need right here
and everything we need is enough just so easy
when the whole world fits inside of your arms
do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
wake up slow
mmmm mmmm
wake up slow
but baby you hardly even notice
when i try to show you
this song is meant to keep you
from doin' what you're supposed to
wakin' up too early
maybe we could sleep
make you banana pancakes
pretend like it's the weekend now
and we could pretend it all the time
can't you see that it's just rainin'
there ain't no need to go outside
ain't no need ain't no need
rain all day and i really really really don't mind
can't you see can't you see
you gotta wake up slow

there's no combination of words
i could put on the back of a postcard
no song that i could sing
but i can try for your heart
our dreams and they are made out of real things
like a shoe box of photographs
with sepiatoned loving
love is the answer
at least for most of the questions in my heart like
why are we here and where do we go
and how come it's so hard
it's not always easy and
sometimes life can be deceiving
i'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together
mmmm it's always better when we're together
yeah we'll look at the stars and we're together
well it's always better when we're together
yeah it's always better when we're together
and all of these moments
just might find their way into my dreams tonight
but i know that they’ll be gone
when the morning light sings
and brings new things
for tomorrow night you see
that they’ll be gone too
too many things i have to do
but if all of these dreams might find their way
into my day to day scene
i'd be under the impression
i was somewhere in between
with only two
just me and you
not so many things we got to do
or places we got to be
we'll sit beneath the mango tree now
yeah it's always better when we're together
mmmm we're somewhere in between together
well it's always better when we're together
yeah it's always better when we're together
mmm mmm mm mm mmm mm mm mmm
mm mm mm mm mmm mmmm mm mmm
i believe in memories they look so
so pretty when i sleep hey now and
when i wake up you look so
pretty sleeping next to me but there is
not enough time there is no
no song i could sing and there is no
combination of words i could say
but i will still tell you one thing

well i was sittin' waitin' wishing
you believed in superstitions
then maybe you'd see the signs
the lord knows that this world is cruel
and i ain't the lord no i'm just a fool
learning lovin' somebody don't make them love you
must i always be waiting waiting on you
must i always be playing playing your fool
i sang your songs i danced your dance
i gave your friends all a chance
but putting up with them
wasn't worth never having you
aw maybe you've been through this before
but it's my first time so please ignore
the next few lines cause they're directed at you
i can't always be waiting waiting on you
i can't always be playing playing your fool
i keep playing your part but it's not my scene
want this plot to twist i've had enough mystery
you keep building it up then shootin' me down
but i'm already down just wait a minute
just sittin' waitin'
just wait a minute
just sittin' waitin'
well if i was in your position
i'd put down all my ammunition
i'd wonder why'd it taken me so long
but lord knows that i'm not you
and if i was i wouldn't be so cruel
cause waitin' on love ain't so easy to do
must i always be waiting waiting on you
must i always be playing playing your fool
no i can't always be waiting waiting on you
i can't always be playing playing your fool fool

who's to say
what's impossible
well they forgot
this world keeps spinning
and with each new day
i can feel a change in everything
and as the surface breaks reflections fade
but in some ways they remain the same
and as my mind begins to spread its wings
there's no stopping curiosity
i want to turn the whole thing upside down
i'll find the things they say just can't be found
i'll share this love i find with everyone
we'll sing and dance to mother nature's songs
i don't want this feeling to go away


who's to say
i can't do everything
well i can try
and as i roll along i begin to find
things aren't always just what they seem
i want to turn the whole thing upside down
i'll find the things they say just can't be found
i'll share this love i find with everyone
we'll sing and dance to mother nature's songs
this world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and
upside down
who's to say what's impossible and can't be found
i don't want this feeling to go away
please don't go away
please don't go away
is this how it's supposed to be
is this how it's supposed to be
na janay kab say umeedein kuch baqi hain
mujhe phir bhi teri yaadkyun aati hai na janay kab say
duur jitna bhi tum mujh say pass teray mein
ab to aadat si hai mujh ko aisay jeenay mein
zindagi say koi shiqwa hi nahi hai
ab to zinda hoon mein is neelay aasman mein
chaahat aisi hai yeh teri barhti jaye
aahat aise hai yeh teri mujhko sataye
yaadain gehri hain yeh kitni dil doob jaye
aur aankhon main yeh ghum num ban jaye
ab tau addat si hai mujhko aise jeene main
sabhi yadein hain sabhi batein hain
bhula do unhein mita do uhein
simona you're getting older
your journey's been
etched on your skin
simona wish i had known that
what seems so strong
has been and gone
i would call you up every day saturday night
and we'd both stayed out 'til the morning light
and we sang "here we go again"
and though time goes by
in a club with you
in
singing "here we go again"
simona
wish i was sober
so i could see clearly now
the rain has gone
simona
i guess it's over
my memory plays our tune
the same old song
i would call you up everyday saturday night
and we'd both stayed out 'til the morning light
and we sang "here we go again"
and though time goes by
in a club with you
in
singing "here we go again"
ah ah
i would call you up every day saturday night
and we'd both stayed out 'til the morning light
and we sang "here we go again"
and though time goes by
in a club with you
in
singing "here we go again"
i would call you up everyday saturday night
and we'd both stayed out 'til the morning light
and we sang "here we go again"
and though time goes by
in a club with you
in
singing "here we go again"
and though time goes by
in a club with you
in
did i disappoint you or let you down
should i be feeling guilty or let the judges frown
'cause i saw the end before we'd begun
yes i saw you were blinded and i knew i had won
so i took what's mine by eternal right
took your soul out into the night
it may be over but it won't stop there
i am here for you if you'd only care
you touched my heart you touched my soul
you changed my life and all my goals
and love is blind and that i knew when
my heart was blinded by you
i've kissed your lips and held your head
shared your dreams and shared your bed
i know you well i know your smell
i've been addicted to you
goodbye my lover
goodbye my friend
you have been the one
you have been the one for me
goodbye my lover
goodbye my friend
you have been the one
you have been the one for me
i am a dreamer but when i wake
you can't break my spirit its my dreams you take
and as i move on remember me
remember us and all we used to be
i've seen you cry i've seen you smile
i've watched you sleeping for a while
i'd be the father of your child
i'd spend a lifetime with you
i know your fears and you know mine
we've had our doubts but now we're fine
and i love you i swear thats true
i cannot live without you
goodbye my lover
goodbye my friend
you have been the one
you have been the one for me
goodbye my lover
goodbye my friend
you have been the one
you have been the one for me
and i still hold your hand in mine
in mine when i'm asleep
and i will bear my soul in time
when i'm kneeling at your feet
goodbye my lover
goodbye my friend
you have been the one
you have been the one for me
i'm so hollow baby i'm so hollow
i'm so i'm so i'm so hollow
i'm so hollow baby i'm so hollow

e|||
my life is brilliant
my love is pure
i saw an angel
of that i'm sure
she smiled at me on the subway
she was with another man
but i won't lose no sleep on that
'cause i've got a plan
you're beautiful you're beautiful
you're beautiful it's true
i saw your face in a crowded place
and i don't know what to do
'cause i'll never be with you
e||
yeah she caught my eye
as we walked on by
she could see from my face that i was
fucking high
and i don't think that i'll see her again
but we shared a moment that will last till the end
you're beautiful you're beautiful
you're beautiful it's true
i saw your face in a crowded place
and i don't know what to do
'cause i'll never be with you
la la la la la la la la la la la la la
you're beautiful you're beautiful
you're beautiful it's true
there must be an angel with a smile on her face
when she thought up that i should be with you
but it's time to face the truth
i will never be with you
let me hold you
for the last time
it's the last chance to feel again
but you broke me
now i can't feel anything
when i love you
it's so untrue
i can't even convince myself
when i'm speaking
it's the voice of someone else
oh it tears me up
i try to hold on but it hurts too much
i try to forgive but it's not enough to make it all okay
you can't play on broken strings
you can't feel anything
that your heart don't want to feel
i can't tell you something that ain't real
oh the truth hurts
and lies worse
how can i give anymore
when i love you a little less than before
oh what are we doing
we are turning into dust
playing house in the ruins of us
running back through the fire
when there's nothing left to save
it's like chasing the very last train when it's too late
oh it tears me up
i try to hold on but it hurts too much
i try to forgive but it's not enough to make it all okay
you can't play on broken strings
you can't feel anything
that your heart don't want to feel
i can't tell you something that ain't real
oh the truth hurts
and lies worse
how can i give anymore
when i love you a little less than before
but we're running through the fire
when there's nothing left to save
it's like chasing the very last train
when we both know it's too late too late
you can't play on broken strings
you can't feel anything
that your heart don't want to feel
i can't tell you something that ain't real
well the truth hurts
and lies worse
how can i give anymore
when i love you a little less than before
oh when i love you a little less than before
let me hold you for the last time
it's the last chance to feel again
i said"grandpa what's this picture here
it's all black and white and it ain't real clear
is that you there he said yeah i was
times were tough back in
that's me and uncle joe just tryin' to survive
a cotton farm
and a great depression
if it looks like we were scared to death
like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
you should've seen it in color
awe and this one here's taken overseas
in the middle of hell in
in the winter time you can almost see my breath
that was my tail gunner ole johnny mcgee
he was a high school teacher from new orleans
and he had my back right through the day we left
if it looks like we were scared to death
like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
you should've seen it in color
a picture's worth a thousand words
but you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
you should've seen it in color
this one is my favorite one
this is me and grandma in the summer sun
all dressed up the day we said our vows
you can't tell it here but it was hot that june
that rose was red and her eyes were blue
and just look at that smile i was so proud
that's the story of my life
right there in black and white
if it looks like we were scared to death
like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
you should've seen it in color
a picture's worth a thousand words
you should've seen it in color
time quietly
e||
well you done done me and you bet i felt it
i tried to be chill but you're so hot that i melted
i fell right through the cracks
now i'm tryin' to get back
before the cool done run out i'll be givin' it my bestest
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
i reckon it's again my turn
to win some or learn some
but i won't hesitate
no more no more
it cannot wait i'm yours
well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn you're free
love love love love
listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
we're just one big family
and it's our godforsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
so i won't hesitate
no more no more
it cannot wait i'm sure
there's no need to complicate our time is short
this is our fate i'm yours

whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
uhhuh mmhmmm
i've been spendin' way too long checkin' my tongue in the mirror
and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
but my breath fogged up the glass
and so i drew a new face and i laughed
i guess what i'd be sayin' is there ain't no better reason
to rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
it's what we aim to do
our name is our virtue
but i won't hesitate
no more no more
it cannot wait i'm yours
well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn you're free
i look into your heart and you will find that the sky is yours
so please don't please don't please don't

the effort to be free
seems pointless from above
you're looking down at me
i'd rather stay below
than have you staring up at me
there's nowhere i want to gooo oooh
ay this business of how long we try to stay alive
why to be here you've first got to die
so i gave it a try
and what do you know
time was so long ago
and things come back you see
to where they don't belong
and every drop of sea
is the whole ocean ooooohh

that's one line i stay right behind
girl i'm in love with you
this ain't the honeymoon
past the infatuation phase
right in the thick of love
at times we get sick of love
it seems like we argue every day
i know i misbehave and you made your mistakes and we both still got room left to grow
and though love sometimes hurt i still put you first and we'll make this thing work but i
think we should take it slow
we're just ordinary people
we don't know which way go
cause we're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow
take it slowoh ohohoh
this time we'll take it slow
take it slowoh ohohoh
this time we'll take it slow
this ain't a movie naw
no fairy tale conclusion ya'll
it gets more confusing every day
sometimes it's heaven sent
then we head back to hell again
we kiss then we make up all the way
i hang up you call
we rise and we fall
and we feel like just like walking away
as our love advances
we take second chances
though it's not a fantasy
i still want you to stay
we're just ordinary people
we don't know which way go
cause we're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow
take it slowoh ohohoh
this time we'll take it slow
take it slowoh ohohoh
this time we'll take it slow
maybe we'll live and learn maybe we'll crash and burn
maybe you'll stay maybe you'll leave maybe you'll return
maybe another fight maybe we won't survive
maybe we'll grow we never know baby you and i
we're just ordinary people
we don't know which way go
cause we're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow
take it slowoh ohohoh
this time we'll take it slow
take it slowoh ohohoh
this time we'll take it slow
we're just ordinary people
we don't know which way go
cause we're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow
take it slowoh ohohoh
this time we'll take it slow
take it slowoh ohohoh
this time we'll take it slow

where all of the walls all continually change
i've done all i can
to stand on the steps with my heart in my hands

fathers be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers be good to your daughters too
oh you see that skin
it's the same she's been standing in
since the day she saw him walkin' away
now she's left cleaning up the mess he made
so fathers be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers be good to your daughters too
boys you can break
find out how much they can take
boys will be strong and
boys soldier on
but boys would be gone
without warmth of a woman's good good heart
on behalf of every man
looking out for every girl
you are the god and the weight of her world
so fathers be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do
girls become lovers who turn into mothers

gravity is working against me
and gravity wants to bring me down
oh i'll never know what makes this man
with all the love that his heart can stand
dream of ways to throw it all away
gravity is working against me
and gravity wants to bring me down
oh twice as much aint twice as good
and can't sustain like a one half could
it's wanting more
that's gonna send me to my knees
oh twice as much aint twice as good
and can't sustain like a one half could
it's wanting more
that's gonna send me to my knees
oh gravity stay the hell away from me
oh gravity has taken better men than me
just keep me where the light is
just keep me where the light is
just keep me where the light is
come on keep me where the light is
come on keep me where the light is
come on keep me where keep me where the light is


it's not a silly little moment
it's not the storm before the calm
this is the deep and dying breath of
this love that we've been working on
can't seem to hold you like i want to
so i can feel you in my arms
nobody's gonna come and save you
we've pulled too many false alarms
we're going down
and you can see it too
we're going down
and you know that we're doomed
my dear we're slow dancing in a burning room
i was the one you always dreamed of
you were the one i tried to draw
how dare you say it's nothing to me
baby you're the only light i ever saw
i'll make the most of all the sadness
you'll be a bitch because you can
you try to hit me just to hurt me so you leave me feeling dirty
because you can't understand
we're going down
and you can see it too
we're going down
and you know that we're doomed
my dear we're slow dancing in a burning room
go cry about it why don't you repeat times
my dear we're slow dancing in a burning room
don't you think we outta know by now
don't you think we should've learned somehow
don't you think we outta know by now
don't you think we should've learned somehow
don't you think we outta know by now
don't you think we should've learned somehow

no i'm not color blind
i know the world is black and white
try to keep an open mind but
i just can't sleep on this tonight
stop this train i want to get off and go home again
i can't take the speed it's moving in i know i can't
but honest ly won't someone stop this train
don't know how else to say it don't want to see my parents go
one generation's length away
from fighting life out on my own
stop this train i want to get off and go home again
i can't take the speed it's moving in i know i can't
but honest ly won't someone stop this train
so scared of getting older
i'm only good at being young
so i play the numbers game to find away to say that life has just begun
had a talk with my old man
said help me understand
he said turn you'll renegotiate
don't stop this train
don't for a minute change the place you're in
don't think i couldn't ever understand i tried my hand
john honest ly we'll never stop this train
see once in a while when it's good
it'll feel like it should
and they're all still around
and you're still safe and sound
and you don't miss a thing
'til you cry when you're driving a way in the dark
singing stop this train i want to get off and go home again
i can't take this speed it's moving in i know i can't
cause now i see i'll never stop this train
me and all my friends we're all misunderstood
they say we stand for nothing and theres no way we ever could
now we see everything that's going wrong with the world and those who lead it
we just feel like we don't have the means to rise above and beat it
so we keep waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
it's hard to beat the system when you're standing at a distance
so we keep waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
now if we had the power to bring our neighbors home from war
they would have never missed a christmas no more ribbons on their door
and when you trust your television what you get is what you got
cause when they own the information oh they can bend it all they want
that's why we're waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
it's not that we don't care we just know that the fight ain't fair
so we keep on waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
and we're still waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
one day our generation is gonna rule the population
we keep on waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting waiting waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting waiting waiting on the world to change

i'm goin' down to the greyhound station gonna buy a ticket to ride
gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
sing my song for the people i meet
and get along with it all
where the people say "y'all"
sing a song with a friend
change the shape that i'm in
and get back in the game
and start playin' again
i'd like to stay but i might have to go to start over again
might go back down to texas might go to somewhere that i've never been
and get up in the mornin' and go out at night
and i won't have to go home
get used to bein' alone
change the words to this song
start singin' again
i'm tired of runnin' round lookin' for answers to questions that i already know
i could build me a castle of memories just to have somewhere to go
count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again
feed the pigeons some clay
turn the night into day
start talkin' again when i know what to say
i'm goin' down to the greyhound station gonna buy a ticket to ride
gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
sing my song for the people i meet
and get along with it all
where the people say "y'all"
feed the pigeons some clay
turn the night into day
start talkin' again when i know what to say
i hurt myself today to see if i still feel
i focus on the pain the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away but i remember everything
what have i become my sweetest friend
everyone i know goes away in the end
and you could have it all my empire of dirt
i will let you down i will make you hurt
i wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts i cannot repair
beneath the stains of time the feelings disappear
you are someone else i am still right here
what have i become my sweetest friend
everyone i know goes away in the end
and you could have it all my empire of dirt
i will let you down i will make you hurt
if i could start again a million miles away
i would keep myself i would find a way

but i won't back down
gonna stand my ground won't be turned around
and i'll keep this world from draggin' me down
gonna stand my ground and i won't back down
hey baby there ain't no easy way out
hey i will stand my ground and i won't back down
well i know what's right i got just one life
in a world that keeps on pushin' me around
but i'll stand my ground and i won't back down
hey baby there ain't no easy way out
hey i will stand my ground and i won't back down
no i won't back down
is it getting better
or do you feel the same
will it make it easier on you now
you got someone to blame
you say
one love
one life
when it's one need
we get to share it
it leaves you baby
if you don't care for it
did i disappoint you
or leave a bad taste in your mouth
you act like you never had love
and you want me to go without
well it's
too late
tonight
to drag the past out
into the light
but we're not the same
we get to carry each other
carry each other

have you come to raise the dead
have you come here to play jesus
to the lepers in your head
too much
more than a lot
now it's all i got
but we're not the same
we hurt each other
then we do it again
love is a temple
love a higher law
love is a temple
love the higher law
you ask me to enter
but then you make me crawl
and i can't be holding on
when all you got is hurt
one love
one blood
one life
you got to do what you should
one life
with each other
sisters
brothers
one life
but we're not the same
we get to carry each other
carry each other
one

belinda was mine 'til the time that i found her
holdin' jim and loving him
then sue came along loved me strong that's what i thought

don't know that i will but until i can find me
a girl who’ll stay and won't play games behind me
i'll be what i am a solitary man solitary man
i've had it to here being where love's a small word
a part time thing a paper ring
i know it's been done havin' one girl who loves me
right or wrong weak or strong
don't know that i will but until i can find me
the girl who’ll stay and won't play games behind me
i'll be what i am a solitary man solitary man
don't know that i will but until love can find me
the girl who’ll stay and won't play games behind me
i'll be what i am a solitary man solitary man

there's a man goin' 'round takin' names
and he decides who to free and who to blame
everybody won't be treated all the same
there'll be a golden ladder reaching down
when the man comes around
the hairs on your arm will stand up
at the terror in each sip and each sup
will you partake of that last offered cup
or disappear into the potter's ground
when the man comes around
hear the trumpets hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singin'
multitudes are marchin' to a big kettledrum
voices callin' voices cryin'
some are born and some are dyin'
it's alpha and omega kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn trees
and the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind in the thorn trees
it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
till armageddon no shalom no shalom
then the father hen will call his chicken's home
the wise man will bow down before the throne
and at his feet they will cast the golden crowns…
when the man comes around
whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
listen to the words long written down
when the man comes around
hear the trumpets hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singing
multitudes are marchin' to a big kettledrum
voices callin' voices cryin'
some are born and some are dyin'
it's alpha and omega kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn trees
and the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind in the thorn trees
it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
in measured hundred weight and penny pound
when the man comes around

in that bright land
to which i go
i'm going there
to see my father
and all my loved ones
who've gone on
i'm just going over jordan
i'm just going over home
i know dark clouds
i know my way
is hard and steep
where god's redeemed
their vigils keep

g
called her for the first time yesterday
finally found the missing part of me
i felt so close but you were far away
left me without anything to say
now i'm speechless over the edge i'm just breathless
i never thought that i'd catch this love bug again
hopeless head over heels in the moment
i never thought that i'd get hit by this love bug again
i can't get your smile out of my mind
i think about your eyes all the time
you're beautiful but you don't even try
modesty is just so hard to find
now i'm speechless over the edge i'm just breathless
i never thought that i'd catch this love bug again
hopeless head over heels in the moment
i never thought that i'd get hit by this love bug again
i kissed her for the first time yesterday
everything i wished that it would be
suddenly i forgot how to speak
hopeless breathless baby can't you see
now i'm speechless over the edge i'm just breathless
i never thought that i'd catch this love bug again
now i'm hopeless head over heels in the moment
i never thought that i'd get hit by this love bug again
oooh lovebug again
o holy night
the stars are brightly shining
of the dear saveours birth
long lay the world in sin and errors pinning
till he appeared
and the soul felt its worth
the thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
fall on your knees
oh hear the angels voices
oh night divine
oh night that christ was born
oh night divine
oh night when christ was born
chains shall he break
for the slave is our brother
and in his name all oppression shall cease
sweet hymns of joy
in grateful chorus raise we
let all within us praise his holy name
christ is the lord let ever ever praise thee
noël noël
oh night oh night divine
noël noël
oh night oh night divine
noël noël
oh oh night oh night divine
when i am down and oh my soul so weary
when troubles come and my heart burdened be
then i am still and wait here in the silence
until you come and sit awhile with me
you raise me up so i can stand on mountains
you raise me up to walk on stormy seas
i am strong when i am on your shoulders
you raise me up to more than i can be
you raise me up so i can stand on mountains
you raise me up to walk on stormy seas
i am strong when i am on your shoulders
you raise me up to more than i can be
you raise me up so i can stand on mountains
you raise me up to walk on stormy seas
i am strong when i am on your shoulders
you raise me up to more than i can be
you raise me up so i can stand on mountains
you raise me up to walk on stormy seas
i am strong when i am on your shoulders
you raise me up to more than i can be
you raise me up to more than i can be
there's a long black train comin down the line

tengo la camisa negra
hoy mi amor está de luto
hoy tengo en el alma una pena
y es por culpa de tu embrujo
hoy sé que tu ya no me quieres
y eso es lo que mas me hiere
que tengo la camisa negra
y una pena que me duele
mal parece que solo me quede
y fue pura todita tu mentira
que aquel dia te encontré
por beber del veneno
malevolo de tu amor
yo quede moribundo
y lleno de dolor
respiré de ese humo
amargo de tu adios
y desde que tu te fuiste yo solo
tengo tengo la camisa negra
porque negra tengo el alma
yo por ti perdí la calma
y casi pierdo hasta mi cama
cama c'mon c'mon baby
te digo con disimulo
que tengo la camisa negra
y debajo tengo el difunto pa' enterrartelo cuando quieras mamita
tengo la camisa negra
ya tu amor no me interesa
lo que ayer me supo a gloria
hoy me sabe a pura
miercoles por la tarde
y tu que no llegas
nisiquiera muestras señas
y yo con la camisa negra
y tus maletas en la puerta
mal parece que solo me quede
y fue pura todita tu mentira
que aquel dia te encontré
por beber del veneno
malevolo de tu amor
yo quede moribundo
y lleno de dolor
respiré de ese humo
amargo de tu adios
y desde que tu te fuiste yo solo
tengo tengo la camisa negra
porque negra tengo el alma
yo por ti perdí la calma
y casi pierdo hasta mi cama
cama c'mon c'mon baby
te digo con disimulo
que tengo la camisa negra
y debajo tengo el difunto

it was my thoughts were short my hair was long
caught somewhere between a boy and man
she was and she was far from in between
it was summertime in northern michigan
splashin' thru the sandbar talkin' by the campfire
it's the simple things in life like when and where
we didn't have no internet but man i never will forget
the way the moonlight shined upon her hair
and we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things
makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin' whisky out the bottle not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
catchin' walleye from the dock watchin' waves roll off the rocks
she'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
we'd blister in the sun we couldn't wait for night to come
to hit that sandy place of rock 'n roll
and we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things
makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin' whisky out the bottle not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
now nothin' seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
oh how we thought those days would never end
sometimes i hear that song and i'll start to sing along
and think man i'd like to see that girl again
and we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things
makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin' whisky out the bottle not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
and we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things
makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin' whisky out the bottle not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
livin' my life in a slow hell
different girl every night at the hotel
i aint seen the sun shine in damn days
been fuelin' up on cocaine and whisky
wish i had a good girl to miss me
lord i wonder if i'll ever change my ways
i put your picture away
sat down and cried today
i can't look at you i'm lyin' next to her
i put your picture away sat down and cried today
i can't look at you i'm lyin' next to her

fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
i ain't heard from you in damn nights
i put your picture away
i wonder where you been
i can't look at you while i'm lyin' next to him

what day is it
and in what month
this clock never seemed so alive
i can't keep up
and i can't back down
i've been losing
so much time
cause' it's you and me
and all of the people
with nothing to do
nothing to lose
cause' it's you and me
and all of the people
and i don't know why
i can't keep my eyes off of you
what other things
that i wanna say
just aren't coming out right
i'm tripping on words
you've got my head spinning
i don't know where to go from here
cause' it's you and me
and all of the people
with nothing to do
and nothing to prove
and it's you and me
and all of the people
and i don't know why
i can't keep my eyes off of you
something about you now
i can't quite figure out
everything she does is beautiful
everything she does is right
cause' it's you and me
and all of the people
with nothing to do
and nothing to lose
and it's you and me
and all of the people
and i don't know why
i can't keep my eyes off of
you and me
and all of the people
with nothing to do
and nothing to prove
and it's you and me

no one knows what it's like
to be the bad man
to be the sad man
behind blue eyes
and no one knows what it's like
to be hated
to be fated
to telling only lies
but my dreams
they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours only lonely
my love is vengeance
that's never free
no one knows what it's like
to feel these feelin's
like i do
and i blame you
no one bites back as hard
on their anger
none of my pain an' woe
can show through
but my dreams
they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours only lonely
my love is vengeance
that's never free
discover limp say it
discover limp say it
discover limp say it
discover limp say it
no one knows what it's like
to be mistreated
to be defeated
behind blue eyes
and no one knows how to say
that they're sorry
an' don't worry
i'm not telling lies
but my dreams
they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours only lonely
my love is vengeance
that's never free
no one knows what it's like
to be the bad man
to be the sad man

crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming confusing
this lack of self control i fear is never ending
controlling
i can't seem
to find myself again
my walls are closing in
i've felt this way before
so insecure
crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
distracting reacting
against my will i stand beside my own reflection
it's haunting how i can't seem
to find myself again
my walls are closing in
i've felt this way before
so insecure
crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
it starts with one thing i don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
to explain in due time
all i know time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away
it's so unreal didn't look out below
watch the time go right out the window
trying to hold on but didn't even know
wasted it all just to
watch you go i kept everything inside
and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually
be a memory of a time when
i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn't even matter
one thing i don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
to remind myself how
i tried so hard in spite of the way you were mocking me
acting like i was part of your property
remembering all the times you've fought with me
i'm surprised it got so far
things aren't the way they were before
you wouldn't even recognize me anymore
not that you knew me back then
but it all comes back to me
in the end
and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually
be a memory of a time when
i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn't even matter
i put my trust in you pushed as far as i can go
and for all this there's only one thing you should know
i put my trust in you pushed as far as i can go
and for all this there's only one thing you should know
i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn't even matter

i dreamed i was missing
you were so scared
but no one would listen
cuz no one else cared
after my dreaming
i woke with this fear
what am i leaving
when i'm done here
so if you're asking me i want you to know
e||
when my time comes
forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
and don't resent me
and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest leave out all the rest
don't be afraid
of taking my beatings
i've shared what i made
i'm strong on the surface
not all the way through
i've never been perfect
but neither have you
so if you're asking me i want you to know
when my time comes
forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me
and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest leave out all the rest
forgetting
all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
someone else can come and save me from myself
i can't be who you are
when my time comes
forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me
and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest leave out all the rest
forgetting
all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
someone else can come and save me from myself
i can't be who you are
i can't be who you are
i'm tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
don't know what you're expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
every step i take is another mistake to you
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
i've become so tired so much more aware
i'm becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
can't you see that you're smothering me
holding too tightly afraid to lose control
cause everything that you thought i would be
has fallen apart right in front of you
every step that i take is another mistake to you
and every second i waste is more than i can take
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
i've become so tired so much more aware
i'm becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
and i know
i may end up failing too
but i know
you were just like me with someone disappointed in you
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
i've become so tired so much more aware
i'm becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
tired of being what you want me to be
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
tired of being what you want me to be
i close both locks below the window
i close both blinds and turn away
sometimes solutions aren't so simple
sometimes good bye's the only way
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
in cards and flowers on your window
your friends all plead for you to stay
sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
sometimes good bye's the only way
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
in this farewell
there’s no blood
there’s no alibi
‘cause i’ve drawn regret
from the truth
of a thousand lies
so let mercy come
and wash away
what i’ve done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i’ve become
erase myself
and let go of what i’ve done
put to rest
what you thought of me
while i clean this slate
with the hands
of uncertainty
so let mercy come
and wash away
what i’ve done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i’ve become
erase myself
and let go of what i’ve done
for what i’ve done
i’ll start again
and whatever pain may come
today this ends
i’m forgiving what i’ve …
done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i’ve become
erase myself
and let go of what i’ve done
what i’ve done
forgiving what i’ve done
away thanks

sunday morning rain is falling
steal some covers share some skin
clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
you twist to fit the mold that i am in
but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
and i would gladly hit the road get up and go if i knew
that someday it would lead me back to you
that someday it would lead me back to you
that may be all i need
in darkness she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave
fingers trace your every outline
paint a picture with my hands
back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
change the weather still together when it ends
that may be all i need
in darkness she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave


but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
and i would gladly hit the road get up and go if i knew
that someday it would lead me back to you
that someday it would lead me back to you
that may be all i need
in darkness she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave
i was so high i did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
never to return again
but always in my heart
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i won't say goodbye anymore
i tried my best to feed her appetite
keep her coming every night
so hard to keep her satisfied
kept playing love like it was just a game
pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again oh
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i won't say goodbye anymore
i'll fix these broken things
repair your broken wings
and make sure everything's alright it's alright
my pressure on her hips
sinking my fingertips
into every inch of you
cause i know that's what you want me to do
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i won't say goodbye anymore
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i won't say goodbye anymore
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i won't say goodbye anymore
i asked her to staybut she wouldn't listen
she left before i had the chance to say oh
the words that were mendthe things that were broken
but now it's far too late she's gone away
every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking why does this happen to me
why does every moment have to be so hard
hard to believe it
it's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i won't go home without you
the taste of her breath i'll never get over
and the noises that she made kept me awake oh
the weight of things that remained unspoken
built up so much it crushed us every day
every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking why does this happen to me
why does every moment have to be so hard
hard to believe it
it's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i won't go home without you
it's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i won't go home without you
of all the things i felt i've never really showed
perhaps the worst is that i ever let you go should not ever let you go oh oh oh
it's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i won't go home without you
it's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i won't go home without you
i won't go home without you
i won't go home without you
all day staring at the ceiling making
friends with shadows on my wall
all night i'm hearing voices telling me that
i should get some sleep because tomorrow might be good for something
hold on i'm feeling like i'm headed for a
break down and i don't know why
but i'm not crazy i'm just a little unwell i know right now you can't tell
but stay a while and maybe then you'll see a different side of me
i'm not crazy i'm just a little impaired i know right now you don't care
but soon enough you're gonna think of me and how i used to
be me talking to myself in public and dodging glances on the train
and i know i know they've all been talking about me
i can hear them whisper and it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong
with me out of all the hours thinking
some how i've lost my mind
but i'm not crazy i'm just a little unwell i know right now you can't tell
but stay a while and maybe then you'll see a different side of me
i'm not crazy i'm just a little impaired i know right now you don't care
but soon enough you're gonna think of me and how i used to be
i've been talkin' in my sleep
pretty soon they'll come to get me
yeh they're takin' me away
but i'm not crazy i'm just a little unwell i know right now you can't tell
but stay a while and maybe then you'll see a different side of me
i'm not crazy i'm just a little impaired i know right now you don't care
but soon enough you're gonna think of me and how i used to be
hey how i used to be yeah
how i use to be yeah
well i'm just a little unwell
how i used to be fade
sometimes i lay under the moon i thank god i'm breathin'
then i pray don't take me soon 'cause i am here for reason
sometimes in my tears i drown but i never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds i know someday it'll all turn around because
all my life i been waiting for i been praying for for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more there'll be no more wars and our children will play
one day one day one day oh oh oh
one day one day one day oh oh oh
it's not about win or lose 'cause we all lose when they feed on the
souls of the innocent blooddrenched pavement keep on movin' though the waters stay ragin'
in this maze you could lose your way your way
it might drive you crazy but don't let it phase you no way no way
sometimes in my tears i drown i drown but i never let it get me down get me down
so when negativity surrounds surrounds i know someday it'll all turn around because
all my life i been waiting for waiting for i been praying for for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more fight no more there'll be no more wars and our children will play
one day one day one day oh oh oh
one day one day one day oh oh oh
one day this all will change treat people the same stop with the violence down with the hate
one day we'll all be free and proud to be under the same sun singin' songs of freedom like
wye oh wye oh oh oh
wye oh wye oh oh oh
all my life i been waiting for i been praying for for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more there'll be no more wars and our children will play
one day one day one day oh oh oh

a family of trees wanting to be haunted
control yourself
take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanting to be haunted
the water is warm
but it's sending me shivers
a baby is born
crying out for attention
the memories fade
like looking through a fogged mirror
decisions too
decisions are made and not bought
but i thought this wouldn't hurt a lot i guess not

up those stairs in that little back bedroom
is where i did my homework and i learned to play guitar
and i bet you didn't know under that live oak
my favorite dog is buried in the yard
i thought if i could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healin'
out here it's like i'm someone else
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could just come in i swear i'll leave
won't take nothin' but a memory
from the house that built me
mama cut out pictures of houses for years
from "better homes and garden" magazine
plans were drawn and concrete poured and
nail by nail and board by board
daddy gave life to mama's dream
i thought if i could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healin'
out here it's like i'm someone else
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could just come in i swear i'll leave
won't take nothin' but a memory
from the house that built me
you leave home and you move on and you do the best you can
i got lost in this old world and forgot who i am
i thought if i could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healing
out here it's like i'm someone else
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could walk around i swear i'll leave
won't take nothin' but a memory
from the house that built me
i backed my car into a cop car the other day
well he just drove off sometimes life's okay
i ran my mouth off a bit too much oh what can i say

and we'll all float on okay
and we'll all float on okay
and we'll all float on okay
and we'll all float on anyway well
well a fake jamaican took every last dime with that scam
it was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
bad news comes don't you worry even when it lands
good news will work its way to all them plans
we both got fired on exactly the same day
well we'll float on good news is on the way
and we'll all float on okay

sandali na lang
maaari bang pagbigyan
aalis na nga
maaari bang hawakan
ang iyong mga kamay
sana ay maabot ng langit
ang iyong mga ngiti
sana ay maisilip
wag kang magalala
di ko ipipilit sa'yo
kahit na lilipad
ang isip ko'y torete sa'yo
ilang gabi pa nga lang
nang tayo'y pinagtagpo
na parang may tumulak
nanlalamig nanginginig na ako
akala ko nung una
may bukas ang ganito
mabuti pang umiwas
torete torete torete ako
torete torete torete sa'yo
wag kang magalala
di ko ipipilit sa'yo
kahit na lilipad
torete torete torete ako

i wear women's underwear
and then i go to strike a pose in my full length mirror
i cross my legs just like a queer
but my libido is strong when a lady is near ya
what defines a straight man straight
is it the boxer in the briefs or a twelve ounce steak
i'll tell you what a woman loves most
it's a man who can slap but can also stroke
goin' in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
it's verbatim and it's shakin'
no no no no no no no no
no no no more getting elated
no more listless invitations
i live by a hospital
and every day i go out walking past its sickly windows
i see people dying there
but my tender age makes it hard to care
incinerator and a big smoke stack
it's a phallic symbol and it makes me laugh ha
all i need is a heart attack
c'mon humble my bones with a cardiac
goin' in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
it's verbatim and it's shakin'
no no no no no no no no
no no no more getting elated
no more listless invitations
for the love of fuck
for the sake of pete
did you ever really think
you'd love a guy like me
i am the rooster in the morning
i'm the cock of the day
i'm the boxer in the briefs
i'm a twelve ounce steak
ehoh ehoh ehoh yehbo
yehbo yehbo yehbo yehbooooo
it's verbatim
and ya and it's naked
and ya and it's shakin'
it shakes shakes shakes
oh oh yea eah oh oh woo ooh ooh
oh oh yea eah oh oh woo ooh ooh
oh oh yea eah oh oh
weep for yourself my man
you'll never be what is in your heart
weep little lion man
you're not as brave as you were at the start
rate yourself and rake yourself
take all the courage you have left
wasted on fixing all the
problems that you made in your own head
but it was not your fault but mine
and it was your heart on the line
i really fucked it up this time
didn't i my dear
didn't i my
tremble for yourself my man
you know that you have seen this all before
tremble little lion man
you'll never settle any of your scores
your grace is wasted in your face
your boldness stands alone among the wreck
now learn from your mother or else
spend your days biting your own neck
but it was not your fault but mine
and it was your heart on the line
i really fucked it up this time
didn't i my dear
but it was not your fault but mine
and it was your heart on the line
i really fucked it up this time
didn't i my dear
didn't i my dear
but it was not your fault but mine
and it was your heart on the line
i really fucked it up this time
didn't i my dear
but it was not your fault but mine
didn't i my dear
it's empty in the valley of your heart
the sun it rises slowly as you walk
away from all the fears
and all the faults you've left behind
the harvest left no food for you to eat
you cannibal you meateater you see
but i have seen the same
i know the shame in your defeat
but i will hold on hope
and i won't let you choke
on the noose around your neck
and i'll find strength in pain
and i will change my ways
i'll know my name as it's called again
cause i have other things to fill my time
you take what is yours and i'll take mine
now let me at the truth
which will refresh my broken mind
so tie me to a post and block my ears
i can see widows and orphans through my tears
i know my call despite my faults
and despite my growing fears
but i will hold on hope
and i won't let you choke
on the noose around your neck
and i'll find strength in pain
and i will change my ways
i'll know my name as it's called again
so come out of your cave walking on your hands
and see the world hanging upside down
you can understand dependence
when you know the maker's hand
so make your siren's call
and sing all you want
i will not hear what you have to say
cause i need freedom now
and i need to know how
to live my life as it's meant to be
but i will hold on hope
and i won't let you choke
on the noose around your neck
and i'll find strength in pain
and i will change my ways
i'll know my name as it's called again
birds flying high you know how i feel
sun in the sky you know how i feel
reeds driftin' on by you know how i feel
it's a new dawn
it's a new day
it's a new life
for me
and i'm feeling good
fish in the sea you know how i feel
river running free you know how i feel

and this old world
is a new world
and a bold world
for me
and i'm feeling good
stars when you shine you know how i feel
scent of a pine you know how i feel
freedom is mine and you know how i feel
it's a new dawn
it's a new day
it's a new life
for me
and i'm feeling good
it's buggin' me grating me
and twisting me around
yes i'm endlessly caving in
and turnin' inside out
'cause i want it now
i want it now
give me your heart and your soul
and i'm breakin out
i'm breakin out
last chance to lose control
it's holdin' me morphin' me
and forcin' me to strive
to be endlessly cold within
and dreaming i'm alive
'cause i want it now
i want it now
give me your heart and your soul
i'm not breaking down
i'm breakin out
last chance to lose control
and i want you now
i want you now
i feel my heart implode
i'm breakin' out
escaping now
feelin' my faith erode
come ride with me
through the veins of history
i'll show you a god who
falls asleep on the job
and how can we win when
fools can be kings
don't waste your time or time
will waste you
no one's gonna take me alive

it was a lie when they smiled
and as we ran from the cops
we laughed so hard it would sting
yeah yeah oh
if i'm so wrong so wrong so wrong
how can you listen all night long night long night long
now will it matter after i'm gone
because you never learn a goddamn thing
you're just a sad song with nothing to say
about a life long wait for a hospital stay

this never meant nothing to ya
i spent my high school career
so i could watch all my heroes
bring out the old guillotine
we'll show 'em what we all mean
yeah yeah oh
if i'm so wrong so wrong so wrong
how can you listen all night long night long night long
now will it matter after i'm gone
because you never learn a goddamn thing

about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong
this never meant nothing to ya
so go go away just go run away
but where did you run to and where did you hide

about a life long wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that i'm wrong

long ago just like the hearse you died to get in again
we are so far from you
burning on just like a match you strike to incinerate
the lives of every one you knew
and whats the worst to take from every heart you break
like a blade you stain i've been holding on tonight
whats the worst thing i can say things are better if i stay
so long and goodnight so long and goodnight
came a time where every star fall brought you to tears again
we are the very hurt you sold
and whats the worst to take from every heart you break
like a blade you stain i've been holding on tonight
whats the worst thing i can say things are better if i stay
so long and goodnight so long and goodnight
and if i carry on this way thing are better if i stay
so long and goodnight so long and goodnight
can you hear me

so long and goodnight so long and goodnight
well if you carry on this way thing are better if i stay
so long and goodnight so long and goodnight
well when you go
don't ever think i'll make you try to stay
and maybe when you get back
i'll be off to find another way
and after all this time that you still owe
you're still the good for nothing i don't know
so take your gloves and get out better get out
while you can
when you go
would you even turn to say
i don't love you
like i did
yesterday
sometimes i cry so hard from pleading
so sick and tired of all the needless beating
but baby when they knock you down and out
it's where you oughta stay
and after all the blood that you still owe
another dollar's just another blow
so fix your eyes and get up better get up
while you can
when you go
would you even turn to say
i don't love you
like i did
yesterday
e||

would you have the guts to say
i don't love you

like i loved you
yesterday

if you could coddle the infection
they can amputate at once
you should've been
i could have been a better son
she said "you ain't no son of mine
for what you've done they're gonna find
and just you mind your manners when you go
and when you go don't return to me my love"
mama we all go to hell
mama we all go to hell
it's really quite pleasant
except for the smell
mama we all go to hell
mama mama mama
mama mama mama
and if you would call me your sweetheart
i'd maybe then sing you a song
but the shit that i've done with this fuck of a gun
you would cry out your eyes all along
we're damned after all
through fortune and flame we fall
and if you can stay then i'll show you the way
to return from the ashes you call
we all carry on
when our brothers in arms are gone
so raise your glass high
for tomorrow we die
and return from the ashes you call
they're gonna clean up your looks
to make a citizen out of you
because they sleep with a gun
and keep an eye on you son
so they can watch all the things you do
because the drugs never work
of keeping you clean
they're gonna rip off your heads
your aspirations to shreds
another cog in the murder machine
they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes
or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone
but not me
the boys and girls in the clique
you're never gonna fit in much kid
but if you're troubled and hurt
what you got under your shirt
will make them pay for the things that they did
they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes
or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone
but not me
they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes
or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone
but not me waaaaah
teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed
so darken your clothes
or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone
but not me
when i was a young boy
my father took me into the
city to see a marching band
he said "son when you grow up
would you be the saviour of the broken the beaten and the damned"
he said "will you defeat them
your demons and all the non believers the plans that they have made"
because one day i'll leave you
a phantom to lead you in the
summer to join the black parade"
sometimes i get the feeling she's watching over me
and other times i feel like i should go
and through it all the rise and fall the bodies in the streets
and when you're gone we want you all to know
we'll carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone believe me
your memory will
carry on
we'll carry on
and in my heart i can't contain it
the anthem won't explain it
a woman sends you reeling from decimated dreams
your misery and hate will kill us all
so paint it black and take it back
lets shout it loud and clear
defiant to the end
we hear the call
we'll carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone believe me
your memory will
carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're broken and defeated
your weary widow marches
on and on we carry through the fears
disappointed faces of your peers
take a look at me cause i could not care at all
do or die
you'll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
you can try you'll never break me
you want it all you wanna play this part
i won't explain or
say i'm sorry
i'm unashamed i'm gonna show my scars
give a cheer for all the broken
listen here because it's who we are
i'm just a man i'm not a hero
i'm just a boy who's meant to sing this song
i'm just a man i'm not a hero
i don't care
we'll carry on
we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone believe me
your memory will
carry on
you'll carry on
and though you're broken and defeated
your weary widow marches on
do or die you'll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
you can try you'll never break me
you want it all you wanna play this part
do or die you'll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
you can try you'll never break me
you want it all you wanna play this part
i am unwritten
staring at the blank page before you
open up the dirty window
let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
reaching for something in the distance
so close you can almost taste it
release your inhibitions
feel the rain on your skin no one else can feel it for you
only you can let it in
no one else no one else can speak the words on your lips
drench yourself in words unspoken
live your life with arms wide open
today is where your book begins
the rest is still unwritten
i break tradition
staring at the blank page before you
open up the dirty window
let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
reaching for something in the distance
so close you can almost taste it
release your inhibitions
feel the rain on your skin no one else can feel it for you
only you can let it in
no one else no one else can speak the words on your lips
drench yourself in words unspoken
live your life with arms wide open
today is where your book begins
the rest is still unwritten
staring at the blank page before you
open up the dirty window

because since there's no more you
there's no more anniversary
i'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
and your memory
and how every song reminds me of what used to be
that's the reason i'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing
you were still here
said i'm so sick of love songs
so sad and slow
so why can't i turn off the radio
leave me alone
stupid love songs
dont make me think about her smile
or having my first child

turning off the radio
cuz i'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing
she was still here
said i'm so sick of love songs
so sad and slow
so why can't i turn off the radio
pass me that lovely little gun
my dear my darling one
the cleaners are coming one by one

they are knocking now upon your door
they measure the room they know the score
they're mopping up the butcher's floor
of your broken little hearts

it started out as a bit of fun
here take these before we run away
the keys to the gulag

they're gathering round with all my friends
we're older now the light is dim
and you are only just beginning
oooooooooooooooo children

it's short it's simple it's crystal clear
it's round about it's somewhere here
lost amongst our winnings
oooo children
lift up your voice lift up your voice
children
rejoice rejoice
the cleaners have done their job on you
they're hip to it man they're in the groove
they've hosed you down you're good as new
they're lining up to inspect you
oooooooooooooooo children
poor old jim's white as a ghost
he's found the answer that was lost
we're all weeping now weeping because
there ain't nothing we can do to protect you
oooo children
lift up your voice lift up your voice

and i wanna walk with you on a cloudy day
in fields where the yellow grass grows kneehigh
so won't you try to come
come away with me and we'll kiss on a mountaintop
come away with me and i'll never stop loving you
and i want to wake up with the rain falling on a tin roof
while i'm safe there in your arms
so all i ask is for you
to come away with me in the night
come away with me
i waited 'til i saw the sun
i don't know why i didn't come
i left you by the house of fun
i don't know why i didn't come
i don't know why i didn't come
when i saw the break of day
i wished that i could fly away
instead of kneeling in the sand
catching teardrops in my hand
my heart is drenched in wine
but you'll be on my mind
for ev er
out across the endless sea
i would die in ecstasy
but i'll be a bag of bones
driving down the road alone
my heart is drenched in wine
but you'll be on my mind
for ev er
something has to make you run
i don't know why i didn't come
i feel as empty as a drum
i don't know why i didn't come
i don't know why i didn't come
i don't know why i didn't come

sunrise sunrise
looks like mornin' in your eyes
but the clocks held for hours
sunrise sunrise
couldn't tempt us if it tried
'cause the afternoon's already come and gone
and i said hoo
to you
surprise surprise
couldn't find it in your eyes
but i'm sure it's written all over my face
surprise surprise
never something i could hide
when i see we made it through another day
and i said hoo
to you
now good night
throw its cover down
ooh on me again
ooh and if i'm right
it's the only way
to bring me back
hoo
to you
hoo
when the visions around you
bring tears to your eyes
and all that surrounds you
are secrets and lies
i'll be your strength
i'll give you hope
keeping your faith when it's gone
the one you should call
when you're standing here all alone
and i will take
you in my arms
and hold you right where you belong
till the day my life is through
this i promise you
this i promise you
i've loved you forever
in lifetimes before
and i promise you never
will you hurt anymore
i give you my word
i give you my heart
this is a battle we've won
and with this vow
forever has now begun
just close your eyes
each loving day each loving day
and i know this feeling won't go away
till the day my life is through
this i promise you
ooh i promise you
over and over i fall
when i hear you call
without you in my life baby
i just wouldn't be living at all
and i will take
you in my arms
and hold you right where you belong
till the day my life is through
this i promise you baby
just close your eyes
each loving day each loving day
and i know this feeling won't go away no
every word i say is true
this i promise you
every word i say is true
this i promise you

who kicked a hole in the sky
so the heavens would cry over me
who stole the soul from the sun
in a world come undone at the seams
let there be love
let there be love
i hope the weather is calm
as you sail up your heavenly stream
suspended clear in the sky
are the words that we sing in our dreams
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
come on baby blue
shake up your tired eyes
the world is waiting for you
may all your dreaming fill the empty sky
but if it makes you happy
keep on clapping
just remember i'll be by your side
and if you dont let go its gonna pass you by
who kicked a hole in the sky
so the heavens would cry over me
who stole the soul from the sun
in a world come undone at the seams
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
we the people fight for our existence
we don't claim to be perfect but we're free
we dream our dreams alone with no resistance
fading like the stars we wish to be
you know i didn't mean
what i just said
but my god woke up
on the wrong side of his bed
and it just don't matter now
'cause little by little
we gave you everything you ever dreamed of
little by little
the wheels of your life they're slowly falling off
little by little
you have to give it all with all your life
and all the time i just ask myself why
you're really here
true perfection has to be imperfect
i know that that sounds foolish but it's true
the day has come and now you'll have to accept
the life inside your head we give to you
you know i didn't mean
what i just said
but my god woke up
on the wrong side of his bed
and it just don't matter now
'cause little by little
we gave you everything you ever dreamed of
little by little
the wheels of your life they're slowly falling off
little by little
you have to give it all with all your life
and all the time i just ask myself why
you're really here
hey
'cause little by little
we gave you everything you ever dreamed of
little by little
the wheels of your life they're slowly falling off
little by little
you have to give it all with all your life
and all the time i just ask myself why
you're really here
why am i really here
why am i really here
repeat to fade
sing a sad song in a lonely place
and try to put a word in for me
it's been so long since i found the space
you better put in two or three
we as people are just walking round
our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
what we don't see well it can't be real
what we don't touch we cannot feel
where we're living in this town
the sun is coming up and it's going down
but it's all just the same at the end of the day
and we cheat and we lie
nobody says it's wrong so we don't ask why
cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
throwing it a ll away
we're throwing it a ll away
we're throwing it a ll away at the end of the da hay
if you're needing something i can give
you know id help you if i can
if you're honest and you say that you did
you know that i will give you my hand
or a sad song in lonely place
i'll try to put a word in for you
need a shoulder well if that's the case
you know there's nothing i wouldn't do
where we're living in this town
the sun is coming up and it's going down
but it's all just the same at the end of the day
when we cheat and we lie
nobody says it's wrong so we don't ask why
cause we're all just the same at the end of the day
throwing it a ll away
we're throwing it a ll away
we're throwing it a ll away
we're throwing it a ll away hey yeah

we're throwing it a ll away at the end of the da hay
talking to the songbird yesterday
flew me to a place not far away
singing songs of love to pass the time
give her all the love she gives to me
i've never felt this love from any one
she's not anyone
she's not anyone
a man can never dream these kind of things
especially when she came and spread her wings
then she flew away into the night
give her all the love she gives to me
never felt this love from anyone
she's not anyone
she's not anyone
use
hold on hold on don't be scared
you'll never change what's been and gone
may your smile shine on don't be scared
your destiny may keep you warm
cause all of the stars are fading away
try not to worry you'll see them some day
take what you need and be on your way
and stop crying your heart out
get on come on why you scared
you'll never change what's been and gone
cause all of the stars are fading away
try not to worry you'll see them some day
take what you need and be on your way
and stop crying your heart out
cause all of the stars are fading away
try not to worry you'll see them some day
take what you need and be on your way
and stop crying your heart out
where all of the stars were fading away
try not to worry you'll see them some day
take what you need and be on your way
and stop crying your heart out
stop crying your heart out
stop crying your heart out
stop crying your heart out

stille senker natten seg over deg og over meg
snøen faller alt er hvit se så vakkert alt er blitt
snart er julen her på ny i hver bygd og i hver by
lalalalalalalalala
se nå daler snøen hvit julen se den kommer hit
til vår by og til vår grend der vi sammen nå igjen
tenner gran og julelykt alt er godt og alt er trygt
lalalalalalalalala
nissen kommer hit å ser gaver har han også med
en til far og en til mor en til alle barn på jord
engler svever høyt i sky over hav og land og by
lalalalalalalalala
jorden snurrer rundt seg selv lys blir mørke dag blir kveld
rekk meg hånden kjære venn la ditt øye gli igjen
her står vi i et vennskapsbånd varmen går fra hånd til hånd

her står vi i et vennskapsbånd varmen går fra hånd til hånd

"but what a shame what a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore"

if all our life is but a dream
fantastic posing greed
then we should feed our jewelery to the sea
for diamonds do appear to be
just like broken glass to me
and then she said she can't believe
genius only comes along
in storms of fabled foreign tongues
tripping eyes and flooded lungs
northern downpour sends its love
hey moon please forget to fall down
hey moon don't you go down
sugarcane in the easy mornin'
weathervanes my one and lonely
the ink is running toward the page
it's chasin' off the days
look back at both feet and that winding knee
i missed your skin when you were east
you clicked your heels and wished for me
through playful lips made of yarn
that fragile capricorn
unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
i know the world's a broken bone
but melt your headaches call it home
hey moon please forget to fall down
hey moon don't you go down
sugarcane in the easy morning
weathervanes my one and lonely

i was perched outside in the pouring rain
trying to make myself a sail
then i'll float to you my darlin'

i'm in the business of misery let's take it from the top
she's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock
it's a matter of time before we all run out
when i thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth
i waited eight long months
she finally set him free
i told him i couldn't lie he was the only one for me
two weeks and we had caught on fire
she's got it out for me but i wear the biggest smile
whoa well i never meant to brag
but i got him where i want him now
whoa it was never my intention to brag
to steal it all away from you now
but god does it feel so good
and if you could then you know you would
it just feels so good
second chances they don't ever matter people never change
once a whore you're nothing more i'm sorry that'll never change
and about forgiveness we're both supposed to have exchanged
i'm sorry honey but i'm passing up now look this way
well there's a million other girls who do it just like you
looking as innocent as possible to get to who
they want and what they like it's easy if you do it right
well i refuse i refuse i refuse
whoa well i never meant to brag
but i got him where i want him now
whoa it was never my intention to brag
to steal it all away from you now
but god does it feel so good
and if you could then you know you would
it just feels so goooooooooooood
i watched his wildest dreams come true
not one of them involving you
just watch my wildest dreams come true
not one of them involving
whoa well i never meant to brag
but i got him where i want him now
whoa well i never meant to brag
but i got him where i want him now
whoa it was never my intention to brag
to steal it all away from you now
but god does it feel so good
and if you could then you know you would
it just feels so good
when i was younger i saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
he broke his own heart and i watched as he tried to reassemble it
and my mamma swore she would never let herself forget
and that was the day that i promised i'd never sing of love if it does not
exist but darling
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
maybe i know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
and we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
and i've always lived like this keeping a comfortable distance
and up until now i have swored to myself that i'm content with loneliness
because none of it was ever worth the risk
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
i've got a tight grip on reality but i can't
let go of what's in front of me here
i know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
whoa
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
but you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
and i'm on my way to believing
oh and i'm on my way to believing
bakit pa kailangang magbihis
sayang din naman ang porma
lagi lang namang may sisingit
sa tuwing tayo'y magkasama
bakit pa kailangan ng rosas
kung marami namang magaalay sayo
uupo nalang at aawit
maghihintay ng pagkakataon
hahayaan na lang silang
magkandarapa na manligaw sayo
idadaan na lang kita sa awitin kong ito
sabay ang tugtog ng gitaraohhh
idadaan na lang sa gitara
mapapagod lang sa kakatingin
kung marami namang nakaharang
aawit na lang at magpaparinig
ng lahat ng aking nadarama
pagbibigyan na lang silang
magkandarapa na manligaw sayo
idadaan na lang kita sa awitin kong ito
sabay ang tugtog ng gitaraohhh
idadaan na lang sa gitara
it took one look
then forever they're out in front of me
one smile then i died
only to be revived by you
there i was
thought i had everything figured out
goes to show just how much i know
'bout the way life plays out
i take one step away
then i find myself comin' back to you
my one and only one and only you… ooh
now i know
that i know not a thing not at all
except the fact that i am yours
and that you are mine
oh
they told me that this wouldn't be easy
and though
i'm not one to complain
i take one step away
then i find myself comin' back to you
my one and only one and only
i take one step away
then i find myself comin' back to you
my one and only one and only you… ooh

the selfish they're all standing in line
faithing and hoping to buy themselves time

i only own my mind
the north is to south what the clock is to time
there's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
i know i was born and i know that i'll die
the in between is mine i am mine
and the feeling it gets left behind
all the innocence lost at one time
significant behind the eyes
theres no need to hide
e||||
the ocean is full cause everyone's crying
the full moon is looking for friends at hightide
the sorrow grows bigger when the sorrows denied
i only know my mind i am mine
and the meaning it gets left behind
all the innocence lost at one time
significant behind the eyes
theres no need to hide
e|||
and the feelings that get left behind
all the innocence broken with lies
significance between the lines
we may need to hide
and the meanings that get left behind
all the innocents lost at one time
we're all diffrent behind the eyes
there's no need to hide
yes i understand that every life must end uhhuh
as we sit alone i know someday we must go uhhuh
oh i'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones i love
some folks just have one yeah others they've got none uhhuh

dear mr president come take a walk with me
let's pretend we're just two people and you're not better than me
i'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly
what do you feel when you see the homeless on the street
who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep
what do you feel when you look in the mirror
are you proud
how do you sleep while the rest of us cry
how do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye
how do you walk with your head held high
can you even look me in the eye
and tell me why
dear mr president were you a lonely boy
were you a lonely boy
how can you say no child is left behind
we're not dumb and we're not blind
they're all sitting in your cells
what kind of father might take his own daughter's rights away
and what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay
i can only imagine what the first lady has to say
you've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine
how do you sleep while the rest of us cry
how do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye
how do you walk with your head held high
can you even look me in the eye
let me tell you 'bout hard work
minimum wage with a baby on the way
let me tell you 'bout hard work
rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
let me tell you 'bout hard work
building a bed out of a cardboard box
let me tell you 'bout hard work hard work hard work
you don't know nothing 'bout hard work hard work
hard work
how do you sleep at night
how do you walk with your head held high
dear mr president you'd never take a walk with me
train set and match spied under the blind
shiny and contoured the railway winds
and i've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
the hiss of the train at the railway head
always the summers are slipping away
a ton angel falls to the earth
a pile of old metal a radiant blur
scars in the country the summer and her
always the summers are slipping away
find me a way for making it stay
when i hear the engine pass i'm kissing you wide
the hissing subsides i'm in luck
when the evening reaches here you're tying me up
i'm dying of love it's ok
when i hear the engine pass i'm kissing you wide
the hissing subsides i'm in luck
when the evening reaches here you're tying me up
i'm dying of love it's ok
i'm the next act
waiting in the wings
i'm an animal
trapped in your hot car
i am all the days
that you choose to ignore
you are all i need
you are all i need
i'm in the middle of your picture
lying in the leaves
i'm a moth
who just wants to share your light
i'm just an insect
trying to get out of the night
i only stick with you
because there are no others
you are all i need
you are all i need
i'm in the middle of your picture
lying in the reeds
it's all wrong it's all right
it's all wrong it's all right
it's all wrong it's all right

a farmer and a teacher a hooker and a preacher riding on a midnight
bus bound for mexico one was headed for vacation one for higher
education and two of them were searching for lost souls
that driver never ever saw the stop sign and eighteen wheelers
can't stop on a dime
there are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
why there's not four of them heaven only knows i guess it's not what you
take when you leave this world behind you it's what you leave behind you
when you go
that farmer left a harvest a home and eighty acres the faith and
love for growing things in his young son's heart and that teacher left
her wisdom in the minds of lots of children did her best to give them all
better start
and that preacher whispered can't you see the promised land as he
lay his bloodstained bible in that hookers hands
there are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
why there's not four of them heaven only knows i guess it's not what you
take when you leave this world behind you it's what you leave behind you
when you go
that's the story that our preacher told last sunday as he held his
bloodstained bible up for all of us to see he said bless the farmer and
teacher and that preacher who gave this bible to my momma who read it to me
there are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
why there's not four of them now i guess we know it's not what you
take when you leave this world behind you it's what you leave behind you
when you go
there are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
i set out on a narrow way many years ago
hoping i would find true love along the broken road
but i got lost a time or two
wiped my brow and kept pushing through
i couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
every long lost dream lead me to where you are
others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
i think about the years i spent just passing through
i'd like to have the time i lost and give it back to you
but you just smile and take my hand
you've been there you understand
it's all part of a grander plan that is coming true
every long lost dream lead me to where you are
others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
and now i'm just rolling home into my lover's arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
that god blessed the broken road that led me straight to you oooooooo
oooooooo ooooooo ooo
life's like a road that you travel on
there's one day here and the next day gone
sometimes you bend sometimes you stand sometimes you turn your back to the wind
there's a world outside every darkened door
where blues won't haunt you anymore
where the brave are free and lovers soar come ride with me to the distant shore
we won't hesitate to break down the garden gate
there's not much time left today
life is a highway i wanna ride it all night long
if you're going my way i wanna drive it all night long
through all these cities and all these towns
it's in my blood and in it's all around
i love you now like i loved you then
from mozambique to those memphis nights
the khyber pass to vancouver's lights
knock me down and back up again
there's no load i can't hold a road so rough this i know
i'll be there when the light comes in
just tell 'em we're survivors
life is a highway i wanna ride it all night long
if you're going my way i wanna drive it all night long
life is a highway i wanna ride it all night long
if you're going my way i wanna drive it all night long
there was a distance between you and i between you and i
a misunderstanding once but now we look it in the eye
there ain't no load that i can't hold a road so rough this i know
i'll be there when the light comes in
tell 'em we're survivors
life is a highway i wanna ride it all night long
if you're going my way i wanna drive it all night long
life is a highway i wanna ride it all night long
if you're going my way i wanna drive it all night long
life is a highway i wanna ride it all night long
if you're going my way i wanna drive it all night long

cocaine flame in my bloodstream
sold my coat when i hit spokane
bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes
in the early morning rain
lately my hands they don't feel like mine
my eyes been stung with dust and blind
held you in my arms one time
lost you just the same
jolene i ain't about to go
straight it's too late
i found myself face down in a ditch
booze in my hair and blood on my lips
a picture of you holding a picture of me
in the pocket of my blue jeans
i still don't know what love means
still don't know what love means
jolene la la la la la la la
jolene
been so long since i seen your face
or felt a part of this human race
i've been living out of this here suitcase
for way too long
a man needs something he can hold onto
a nine pound hammer or a woman like you
either one of them things will do
jolene i ain't about to go
straight it's too late
i found myself face down in a ditch
booze in my hair and blood on my lips
a picture of you holding a picture of me
in the pocket of my blue jeans
i still don't know what love means

treating me like benzedrine
automatic laughter from a pro

i'd like to get to know you a little better baby god knows that i really tried
my what a good day for a take out bride

ballorama beauty going toe to toe

i thought about it and i brought it out
i'm motivated by the lack of doubt
i'm consecrated but i'm not devout

i'm travelling from coast to coast
my theory isn't perfect but it's close
i'm almost there why should i care
my heart is hurting when i share
someone opened up let it show
my what a good day for a walk outside
i'd like to think we did it for the better of

really
you are my sweetest downfall
i loved you first i loved you first
beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
i have to go i have to go
your hair was long when we first met
samson went back to bed
not much hair left on his head
he ate a slice of wonder bread and went right back to bed
and history books forgot about us and the bible didn't mention us
and the bible didn't mention us not even once
you are my sweetest downfall
i loved you first i loved you first
beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
but they're just old light they're just old light
your hair was long when we first met
samson came to my bed
told me that my hair was red
told me i was beautiful and came into my bed
oh i cut his hair myself one night
a pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
and he told me that i'd done alright
and kissed me 'til the mornin' light the mornin' light
and he kissed me 'til the mornin' light
samson went back to bed
not much hair left on his head
ate a slice of wonderbread and went right back to bed
oh we couldn't bring the columns down
yeah we couldn't destroy a single one
and history books forgot about us
and the bible didn't mention us not even once
you are my sweetest downfall
i loved you first
it started out as a feeling
which then grew into a hope
which then turned into a quiet thought
which then turned into a quiet word
and then that word grew louder and louder
'til it was a battle cry
i'll come back
when you call me
no need to say goodbye
just because everything's changing
doesn't mean it's never been this way before
all you can do is try to know who your friends are
as you head off to the war
pick a star on the dark horizon
and follow the light
you'll come back
when it's over
no need to say goodbye
you'll come back
when it's over
no need to say goodbye
now we're back to the beginning
it's just a feeling and no one knows yet
but just because they can't feel it too
doesn't mean that you have to forget
let your memories grow stronger and stronger
'til they're before your eyes
you'll come back
when they call you
no need to say goodbye
you'll come back
when they call you
no need to say goodbye

he said
"son have you seen the world
well what would you say
if i said that you could
just carry this gun
you'll even get paid"
i said "that sounds pretty good"
black leather boots
spitshined so bright
they cut off my hair
but it looks alright
we marched and we sang
we all became friends
as we learned how to fight
a hero of war
yeah that's what i'll be
and when i come home
they'll be damn proud of me
i'll carry this flag
to the grave if i must
'cause it's a flag that i love
and it's flag that i trust
i kicked in the door
i yelled my commands
the children they cried
but i got my man
we took him away
a bag over his face
from his family and his friends
they took off his clothes
they pissed in his hands
i told them to stop
but then i joined in
we beat him with guns
and batons not just once
but again and again
a hero of war
yeah that's what i'll be
and when i come home
they'll be damn proud of me
i'll carry this flag
to the grave if i must
'cause it's a flag that i love
and i flag that i trust
she
walked through bullets and haze
i asked her to stop
i begged her to stay
but she pressed on
so i lifted my gun
and i fired away
and the shells
jumped through the smoke
and into the sand
that the blood now had soaked
she collapsed
with a flag in her hand
a flag white as snow
a hero of war
is that what they see
just medals and scars
so damn proud of me
and i brought home that flag
now it gathers dust
but it's a flag that i love
it's the only flag i trust
he said "son have you seen the world
well what would you say
if i said that you could"
it kills me not to know this but i've all but just forgotten
what the color of her eyes were
and her scars or how she got them
as the telling signs of age rain down a single tear is dropping
through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten
there is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
and there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
but seldom do these words ring true when i'm constantly failing you
like walls that we just can't break through until we disappear
so tell me now
if this ain't love then how do we get out
cause' i don't know
that's when she said i don't hate you boy
i just want to save you while there's still something left to save
that's when i told her i love you girl
but i'm not the answer for the questions that you still have
whoa whoa
but the day pressed on like crushing weights
for no man does it ever wait
like memories of dying days
that deafen us like hurricanes
bathed in flames we held the brand
uncurled the fingers in your hand
pressed into the flesh like sand
now do you understand
so tell me now
if this ain't love then how do we get out
cause' i don't know
that's when she said i don't hate you boy
i just want to save you while there's still something left to save
that's when i told her i love you girl
but i'm not the answer for the questions that you still have
whoa whoa
miles away
there's nothing left to say
but so much left that i don't know
we never had a choice
this world is too much noise
it takes me under
it takes me under once again
i don't hate you
i don't hate you no
so tell me now
if this ain't love then how do we get out
cause' i don't know
that's when she said i don't hate you boy
i just want to save you while there's still something left to save
that's when i told her i love you girl
but i'm not the answer for the questions that you still have
i don't hate you
i don't hate you no
whoa whoa
come on hold my hand
i wanna contact the living
not sure i understand
this role i've been given
i sit and talk to god
and he just laughs at my plans
my head speaks a language
i don’t understand
i just wanna feel real love
feel the home that i live in
’cause i got too much life
running through my veins going to waste
i don’t wanna die
but i ain’t keen on living either
before i fall in love
i’m preparing to leave her
i scare myself to death
that’s why i keep on running
before i’ve arrived
i can see myself coming
i just wanna feel real love
feel the home that i live in
’cause i got too much life
running through my veins going to waste
and i need to feel real love
and a life ever after
i cannot get enough
i just wanna feel real love
feel the home that i live in
’cause i got too much love
running through my veins going to waste
i just wanna feel real love
in a life ever after
there’s a hole in my soul
you can see it in my face it’s a real big place
come on hold my hand
i wanna contact the living
not sure i understand
this role i’ve been given
not sure i understand
not sure i understand
not sure i understand
not sure i understand
a drop in the ocean
a change in the weather
i was praying that you and me might end up together
it's like wishing for rain as i stand in the desert
but i'm holding you closer than most
'cause you are my heaven
i don't wanna waste the weekend
if you don't love me pretend
a few more hours then it's time to go
as my train rolls down the east coast
i wonder how you'll keep warm
it's too late to cry too broken to move on
still i can't let you be
most nights i hardly sleep
don't take what you don't need from me
a drop in the ocean
a change in the weather
i was praying that you and me might end up together
it's like wishing for rain as i stand in the desert
but i'm holding you closer than most
'cause you are my heaven
misplaced trust and old friends
never counting regrets
by the grace of god i do not rest at all
and there's days that we'll argue
days that are blue
new england as the leaves change
the last excuse that i'll claim
i was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl
still i can't let you be
most nights i hardly sleep
don't take what you don't need from me
a drop in the ocean
a change in the weather
i was praying that you and me might end up together
it's like wishing for rain as i stand in the desert
but i'm holding you closer than most
'cause you are my
heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
heaven doesn't seem far away
heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
heaven doesn't seem far away
a drop in the ocean
a change in the weather
i was praying that you and me might end up together
it's like wishing for rain as i stand in the desert
but i'm holding you closer than most
'cause you are my heaven
you are my heaven
i’ve heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don’t really care for music do you
it goes like this the fourth the fifth
the minor fall the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to a kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
maybe i’ve been here before
i know this room i’ve walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
i’ve seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
it’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
there was a time when you let me know
what’s really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when i moved in you
the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
maybe there’s a god above
and all i ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it’s not a cry you can hear at night
it’s not somebody who’s seen the light
it’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
harmonica comes in after first measure
when i die lord won’t you put my soul up on a train
won’t you send it southbound give it a cool bluesman name
i’ve been lost out on those back roads so many times i've gone blind
losing faith in my family had drove me right out my damn mind
but on the south side of heaven won’t you take me home
cause i've been broke down for so long and lord it's gettin’ cold
well i've been a desperado in west texas for so long lord i need a change
and for ten long years this old place ain’t seen a drop of rain
and that wind blows everyday lord oh like a desert snow
like a lost bound train running on cocaine and out of control
but on the south side of heaven won’t you take me home
cause i've been broke down for so long and lord it's gettin’ cold
end midway on em while starting the next verse
along those louisiana byways… lonesome highway’s rollin’ on
won’t you take me where the poor man lives… it’s where i call home
and can't you see that a breeze… is nothin’ but a change in pace
money can’t buy my soul… ‘cause it comes from a hard earned place
but on the south side of heaven won’t you take me home
cause i've been broke down for so long and lord it's gettin’ cold
repeat until fade
something always brings me back to you
it never takes too long
no matter what i say or do
i'll still feel you here 'til the moment i'm gone
you hold me without touch
you keep me without chains
i never wanted anything so much
than to drown in your love and not feel your rain
set me free leave me be
i don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
here i am and i stand so tall just the way i'm supposed to be
but you're on to me and all over me
you loved me 'cause i'm fragile
when i thought that i was strong
but you touch me for a little while
and all my fragile strength is gone
set me free leave me be
i don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
here i am and i stand so tall just the way i'm supposed to be
but you're on to me and all over me
i live here on my knees as i try to make you see that you're
everything i think i need here on the ground
but you're neither friend nor foe though i can't seem to let you go
the one thing that i still know is that you're keeping me down
you're on to me you're on to me
all over me
something always brings me back to you
it never takes too long
head under water
and they tell me
to breathe easy for a while
but breathing gets harder
even i know that
you made room for me
but it's too soon to see
if i'm happy in your hands
i'm unusually hard to hold on to
blank stares at blank pages
no easy way to say this
you mean well but you make this hard on me
i'm not gonna write you a love song
cause you asked for it
cause you need one you see
i'm not gonna write you a love song
cause you tell me it's
make or break in this
if you're on your way
i'm not gonna write you to stay
if all you have is leavin' im'a need a better reason
to write you a love song today today yeah
i learned the hard way
that they all say
things you wanna hear
and my heavy heart
sings deep down under you
and your twisted words
your help just hurts
you were not what i thought you were
hello to high and dry
convinced me to please you
made me think that i need this too
i'm trying to let you hear me as i am
i'm not gonna write you a love song
cause you asked for it
cause you need one you see
i'm not gonna write you a love song
cause you tell me it's
make or break in this
if you're on your way
i'm not gonna write you to stay
if all you have is leavin' im'a need a better reason
to write you a love song today
promise me
you'll leave the light on
to help me see
with daylight my guide gone
cause i believe there's a way
you can love me because i say
i won't write you a love song
cause you asked for it
cause you need one you see
i'm not gonna write you a love song
cause you tell me it's
make or break in this
is that why you wanted a love song
cause you asked for it
cause you need one you see

babe i'll walk the seven seas
when i believe that there's a reason
to write you a love song today today
the best thing about tonight’s that we’re not fighting
it couldn’t be that we have been this way before
i know you don’t think that i am trying
i know you’re wearing thin down to the core
but hold your breath
because tonight will be the night that i will fall for you
over again
don’t make me change my mind
i won’t live to see another day
i swear it’s true
because a girl like you is impossible to find
you’re impossible to find

i always swore to you that i would never fall apart
you always thought that i was stronger
i may have failed
but i have loved you from the start
oh but hold your breath
because tonight will be the night that i will fall for you
over again

and remember me tonight
because tonight will be the night that i will fall for you
over again

or i won’t live to see another day
i swear it’s true
because a girl like you is impossible to find
tonight will be the night that i will fall for you
over again
don’t make me change my mind
i won’t live to see another day
i swear it’s true
because a girl like you is impossible to find
you’re impossible to find
i wanted you to know that i love the way you laugh
i wanna hold you high and steal your pain awaaay

i wanna hold you high and steal your pain
because i'm broken when i'm looonesome

the worst is over now and we can breathe again
i wanna hold you high you steal my pain awaaaay
there's so much left to learn and no one left to fight
i wanna hold you high and steal your pain

because i'm brooooken when i'm loooonesome
and i don't feel right when you're gone away
'cause i'm broooken when i'm oooopen

do you ever feel like breaking down
do you ever feel out of place
like somehow you just don't belong
and no one understands you
do you ever wanna run away
do you lock yourself in your room
with the radio on turned up so loud
that no one hears you screaming
no you don't know what its like
when nothing feels alright
you don't know what its like to be like me
to be hurt to feel lost to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when you're down to feel like you've been pushed around
to be on the edge of breaking down when no one's there to save you
no you don't know what its like
welcome to my life
do you wanna be somebody else
are you sick of being so left out
are you desperate to find something more
before your life is over
are you stuck inside a world you hate
are you sick of everyone around
with the big fake smiles and stupid lies
while deep inside you're bleeding
no you don't know what its like
when nothing feels alright
you don't know what its like to be like me
to be hurt to feel lost to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when your down to feel like you've been pushed around
to be on the edge of breaking down when no ones there to save you
no you don't know what its like
welcome to my life
no one ever lies straight to your face
and no one ever stabs you in the back
you might think i'm happy
but i'm not gonna be okay
everybody always gave you what you wanted
you never had to work it was always there
you don't know what it's like what it's like
to be hurt to feel lost to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when you're down to feel like you've been pushed around
to be on the edge of breaking down when no ones there to save you
no you don't know what its like what its like
to be hurt to feel lost to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when you're down to feel like you've been pushed around
to be on the edge of breaking down when no ones there to save you
no you don't know what its like
welcome to my life
welcome to my life
welcome to my life
bury all your secrets in my skin
come away with innocence and leave me with my sins
the air around me still feels like a cage
and love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again…
so if you love me let me go and run away before i know
my heart is just too dark to care i can't destroy what isn't there
deliver me into my fate if i'm alone i cannot hate
i don't deserve to have you…
my smile was taken long ago if i can change i hope i never know
i still press your letters to my lips
and cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
i couldn't face a life without your light
but all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight
so save your breath i will not hear i think i made it very clear
you couldn't hate enough to love is that supposed to be enough
i only wish you weren't my friend then i could hurt you in the end
i never claimed to be a saint…
my own was banished long ago it took the death of hope to let you go
so break yourself against my stones
and spit your pity in my soul
you never needed any help
you sold me out to save yourself
and i won't listen to your shame
you ran away you're all the same
angels lie to keep control…
my love was punished long ago
if you still care don't ever let me know
if you still care don't ever let me know…
she seemed dressed in all of me
stretched across my shame
all the torment and the pain
leaked through and covered me
i'd do anything to have her to myself
just to have her for myself
now i don't know what to do
i don't know what to do
when she makes me sad
she is everything to me
the unrequited dream
the song that no one sings
the unattainable
she's a myth that i have to believe in
all i need to make it real is one more reason
i don't know what to do
i don't know what to do when she makes me sad
but i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
a catch in my throat choke
torn into pieces i won't no
i don't want to be this but
but i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
i won't let this build up inside of me
won’t let this build up inside of me
she isn't real
i can't make her real
she isn't real
i can't make her real
we'll do it all everything on our own
we don't need anything or anyone
if i lay here if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world
i don't quite know how to say how i feel
those three words i said too much but not enough
if i lay here if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world
forget what we're told before we get too old
show me a garden that's bursting into life
let's waste time chasing cars around our heads
i need your grace to remind me to find my own
if i lay here if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world
forget what we're told before we get too old
show me a garden that's bursting into life
all that i am all that i ever was
is here in your perfect eyes they're all i can see
i don't know where confused about how as well
just know that these things will never change for us at all
if i lay here if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world
i'll sing it one last time for you
then we really have to go
you've been the only thing that's right
in all i've done
and i can barely look at you
but every single time i do
i know we'll make it anywhere
anywhere from here
light up light up
as if you have a choice
even if you cannot hear my voice
i'll be right beside you dear
louder louder
and we'll run for our lives
i can hardly speak i understand
why you can't raise your voice to say
to think i might not see those eyes
it makes it so hard not to cry
and as we say our long goodbyes
i nearly do
light up light up
as if you have a choice
even if you cannot hear my voice
i'll be right beside you dear
louder louder
and we'll run for our lives
i can hardly speak i understand
why you can't raise your voice to say
slower slower we dont have time for that
all i want is to find an easier way
to get out of our little heads
have heart my dear we're bound to be afraid
even if its just for a few days
makin' up for all of this mess
light up light up
as if you have a choice
even if you cannot hear my voice
i'll be right beside you dear
wenn man so will bist du das ziel einer langen reise
die perfektion der besten art und weise in stillen momenten leise
die schaumkrone der woge der begeisterung bergauf mein antrieb und schwung
ich wollte dir nur mal eben sagen dass du das größte für mich bist
und sicher gehn ob du denn das selbe für mich fühlst für mich fühlst
wenn man so will bist du meine chillout area meine feiertage in jedem jahr
meine süßwarenabteilung im supermarkt
die lösung wenn mal was hakt so wertvoll das man es sich gerne aufspart
und so schön das man nie darauf verzichten mag
ich wollte dir nur mal eben sagen dass du das größte für mich bist
und sicher gehn ob du denn das selbe für mich fühlst für mich fühlst
ich wollte dir nur mal eben sagen dass du das größte für mich bist
und sicher gehn ob du denn das selbe für mich fühlst für mich fühlst
ende
its been awhile since i could hold my head up high
its been awhile since i first saw you
its been awhile since i could stand on my own two feet again
its been awhile since i could call you
and every thing i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that i've rendered
i stretched myself beyond my means
its been awhile since i couldn't say that i wasn't addicted
its been awhile since i couldn't say i love myself as well as
its been awhile since i've gone and fucked things up just like i always do
its been awhile but all that shit seems to disappear when im with you

'cause inside you're ugly you're ugly like me
i can see through you see to the real you
all the times that i felt like this won't endit's for you
and i taste what i could never haveit was from you

'cause inside you're ugly you're ugly like me

drinking back drinking for two
drinking with you
when drinking was new
sleeping in the back of my car
we never went far
didn't need to go far
you made me feel like the one
you made me feel like the one the one
you made me feel like the one

i don't know where we are going
i don't know where we are going now
wake up call coffee and juice

so take a look at me now

so take a look at me now
so take a look at me now
so take a look at me now
well i took a stroll on the old long walk
on a day iayiay
i met a little girl and we stopped to talk
on a fine soft day iay
and i ask you friend what's a fella to do
'cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
and i knew right then i'd be takin' a whirl
'round the salthill prom with a galway girl
we were halfway there when the rain came down
on a day iayiay
and she asked me up to her flat downtown
of a fine soft day iayiay
and i ask you friend what's a fella to do
'cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
so i took her hand and i gave her a twirl
and i lost my heart to a galway girl
when i woke up i was all alone
with a broken heart and a ticket home
and i ask you now tell me what would you do
if her hair was black and her eyes were blue
boys i ain't never seen nothin' like a galway girl


i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
oh god it feels like forever
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head
cause i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
all i know is that it feels like forever
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head
how do you feel
that is the question
but i forget
when something like a soul
becomes initialized
and folded up like paper dolls and little notes
and while you're outside looking in
describing what you see
remember what you're staring at is me
cause i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has past
all i know is that it feels like forever
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head
how much is real
so much to question
an epidemic of the mannequins
we thought came from the heart
it never did right from the start
just listen to the noises null and void instead of voices
before you tell yourself
it's just a different scene
remember it's just different from what you've seen
i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
all i know is that it feels like forever
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head
cause i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
all i know is that it feels like forever
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head
and it's the starsthe starsthat shine for you
and it's the starsthe starsthat lie to you yeah yeah
and it's the starsthe starsthat shine for you
and it's the starsthe starsthat lie to you yeah yeah
i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
oh god it feels like forever
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head
cause i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
all i know is that it feels like forever
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head
and it's the starsthe starsthat shine for you yeah yeah
and it's the starsthe starsthat lie to you yeah yeah
and it's the starsthe starsthat shine for you yeah yeah
and it's the starsthe starsthat lie to you yeah yeah
oh when the stars oh when the starsthey lie
goldenrod and the stone
the things i brought you
when i found out you had cancer of the bone
your father cried on the telephone
and he drove his car into the navy yard
just to prove that he was sorry
in the morning through the window shade
when the light pressed up against your shoulderblade
i could see what you were reading
all the glory that the lord has made
and the complications you could do without
when i kissed you on the mouth
tuesday night at the bible study
we lift our hands and pray over your body
but nothing ever happens
i remember at michael's house
in the living room when you kissed my neck
and i almost touched your blouse
in the morning at the top of the stairs
when your father found out what we did that night
and you told me you were scared
all the glory when you ran outside
with your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
and you told me not to follow you
sunday night when i cleaned the house
i find the card where you wrote it out
with the pictures of your mother
on the floor at the great divide
with my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
i am crying in the bathroom
in the morning when you finally go
and the nurse runs in with her head hung low
and the cardinal hits the window
in the morning in the winter shade
on the first of march on the holiday
i thought i saw you breathing
all the glory that the lord has made
and the complications when i see his face
in the morning in the window
all the glory when he took our place
but he took my shoulders and he shook my face
and he takes and he takes and he takes
toodoo doo toodoo doo ta da da ta da da da repeated
joy to the world the lord has come
let earth receive her ki ng
let every heart prepare him room
and heaven and nature sing
and heaven and nature sing
and heaven and heaven and nature sing
joy to the world the savior reigns
let men their songs employ y
while fields and floods rocks hills and plains
repeat the sounding joy
repeat the sounding joy
repeat repeat the sounding joy
he rules the world with truth and grace
and makes the nations pro ve
the glories of his righteousness
and wonders of his love
and wonders of his love
and wonders wonders of his love
i tried to be perfect
but nothing was worth it
i don't believe it makes me real
i thought it'd be easy
but no one believes me
i meant all the things i said
if you believe it's in my soul
i'd say all the words that i know
just to see if it would show
that i'm trying to let you know
this place is so empty
my thoughts are so tempting
i don't know how it got so bad
sometimes it's so crazy
that nothing can save me
but it's the only thing that i have
if you believe it's in my soul
i'd say all the words that i know
just to see if it would show
that i'm trying to let you know
that i'm better off on my own
i tried to be perfect
it just wasn't worth it
nothing could ever be so wrong
it's hard to believe me
it never gets easy
i guess i knew that all along
if you believe it's in my soul
i'd say all the words that i know
just to see if it would show
that i'm trying to let you know
that i'm better off on my own
this is the end you know
lady the plans we had went all wrong
we ain't nothing but fight and shout and tears
we got to a point i can't stand
i've had it to the limit i can't be your man
i ain't more than a minute away from walking
we can't cry the pain away
we can't find a need to stay
i slowly realized there's nothing on our side
out of my life out of my mind
out of the tears we can't deny
we need to swallow all our pride
and leave this mess behind
out of my head out of my bed
out of the dreams we had they're bad
tell them it's me who made you sad
tell them the fairytale gone bad
another night and i bleed
they all make mistakes and so did we
but we did something we can never turn back right
find a new one to fool
leave and don't look back i won't follow
we have nothing left it's the end of our time
we can't cry the pain away
we can't find a need to stay
there's no more rabbits in my hat to make things right
out of my life out of my mind
out of the tears we can't deny
we need to swallow all our pride
and leave this mess behind
out of my head out of my bed
out of the dreams we had they're bad
tell them it's me who made you sad
tell them the fairytale gone bad
out of my life out of my mind
out of the tears we can't deny
we need to swallow all our pride
and leave this mess behind
out of my head out of my bed
out of the dreams we had they're bad
tell them it's me who made you sad
tell them the fairytale gone bad
tell them the fairytale gone bad
to be more accurate you can play instead of the in the verse

then we turn around and put up our walls
swimming through the void we hear the word
we lose ourselves but we find it all
’cause we are the ones that wanna play
always wanna go but you never wanna stay
and we are the ones that wanna choose
always wanna play but you never wanna lose ah

breathe without you but i have to
breathe without you but i have to

the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement
walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot
yeah oh yeah
we're drivin' down the road
i wonder if you know
i'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool
run your hands through your hair
absentmindedly making me want you
and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress fearless
so baby drive slow till we run out of road
in this one horse town
i wanna stay right here
in this passenger seat you put your eyes on me
in this moment now capture it remember it
cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress fearless
well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake and i'm not usually this way but
you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's a first kiss it's flawless really something
it's fearless
ohh yeah
and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress fearless
and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress fearless
woahoh oh yeah

you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
its the morning of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
try and stay out of everybodys way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know i haven't seen you around before
'cause when you're fifteen and
somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen
feeling like there's nothing to figure out
well count to ten take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
at fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough you're best friends
laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be out of here as soon as we can
and then you're on your very first date
and he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
and you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
and you're dancing round your room when the night ends
when the night ends
'cause when you're fifteen and
somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen
and your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
but in your life you'll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didnt know it at fifteen
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried
'cause when you're fifteen and
somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen
don't forget to look before you fall
i've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen
la la la la la
la la la la la
your very first day take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

once upon a time i believe it was a tuesday
when i caught your eye we caught onto something
i hold onto the night you looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me were you just kidding
'cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
we almost never speak i don't feel welcome anymore
baby what happened
please tell me cause one second it was perfect
now you're halfway out the door
and i stare at the phone he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
was i out of line did i say something way to honest
made you run and hide like a scared little boy
i looked into your eyes thought i knew you for a minute
now i'm not so sure
so here's to everything coming down to nothing
here's to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going
thought i knew for a minute but i don't anymore
and i stare at the phone he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
did you mean it baby
i don't think so
oh back up baby back up
did you forget everything
back up baby back up
did you forget everything
'cause it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
oh i stare at the phone he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said forever and always
and it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
you didn't mean it baby
you said forever and always
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
once bitten and twice shy
i keep my distance but you still catch my eye
tell me baby do you recognize me
well its been a year it doesn't surprise me
merry christmas i wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying i love you i meant it
now i know what a fool i've been
but if you kiss me now i know you'll fool me again
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
a crowded room and friends with tired eyes
i'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
my god i thought you were someone to rely on
me i guess i was a shoulder to cry on
a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a girl under cover but you tore her apart
maybe this year maybe this year
i'll give it to someone special
because last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
and last christmas
and this year
won't be anything like anything like
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special

romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes
romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult but it's real
don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story baby just say yes oh oh oh
i got tired of waiting wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said
romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone
i love you and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
it's a love story baby just say yes
ohooh ohoh oh
cause we were both young when i first saw you

i was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
he’s got a onehand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around turn the radio down
he says baby is something wrong
i say nothing i was just thinking how we don’t have a song
our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin’ out late tapping on your window
when you’re on the phone and you talk real slow
cause it’s late and your mama don’t know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date “man i didn’t kiss her but i should have”
and when i got home before i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
i was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
had gone all wrong or been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin’ bed
i almost didn’t notice all the roses
and the note that said
our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin’ out late tapping on your window
when you’re on the phone and you talk real slow
cause it’s late and your mama don’t know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date “man i didn’t kiss her but i should have”
and when i got home before i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
da da da da
i’ve heard every album listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song
cause our song is the slamming screen door
sneaking out late tapping on his window
when we’re on the phone and he talks real slow
cause it’s late and his mama don’t know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date “man i didn’t kiss him and i could have”
and when i got home before i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
play it again ho yea ho yea
i was riding shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song

state the obvious i didn’t get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i’m obsessive and crazy
that’s fine you won't mind if i say
and by the way
i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you’re a redneck heartbreak
who’s really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i’m concerned you’re
just another picture to burn
there’s no time for tears
i’m just sitting here planning my revenge
there’s nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddy’s gonna show you how sorry you’ll be
cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you’re a redneck heartbreak
who’s really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
in case you haven’t heard you’re
just another picture to burn
and if you’re missing me
you’d better keep it to yourself
cause coming back around here
would be bad for your health
cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you’re a redneck heartbreak
who’s really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard
i really really hate that
stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you’re a redneck heartbreak
who’s really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i’m concerned you’re
just another picture to burn
burn burn burn baby burn

drew looks at me i fake a smile so he won’t see
that i want and i’m needing everything that we should be
i'll bet she’s beautiful that girl he talks about
and she’s got everything that i have to live without
drew talks to me i laugh cause it’s just so funny
that i can’t even see anyone when he’s with me
he says he’s so in love he’s finally got it right
i wonder if he knows he’s all i think about at night
he’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he’s the song in the car i keep singing don’t know why i do
drew walks by me can he tell that i can’t breathe
and there he goes so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she’d better hold him tight give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she’s lucky cause
he’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he’s the song in the car i keep singing don’t know why i do
so i drive home alone as i turn out the light
i put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
cause he’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
he’s the song in the car i keep singing don’t know why i do
he’s the time taken up but there’s never enough
and he’s all that i need to fall into
drew looks at me i fake a smile so he won’t see

i’m five years old
it’s getting cold
i’ve got my big coat on
i hear your laugh
and look up smiling at you
i run and run
past the pumpkin patch
and the tractor rides look now
the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep
on the way home
i don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you’re not scared of anything at all
don’t know if snow white’s house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today
i’m thirteen now
and don’t know how my friends
could be so mean
i come home crying
and you hold me tight
and grab the keys
and we drive and drive
until we found a town
far enough away
and we talk and windowshop
'til i’ve forgotten all their names
i don’t know who i’m gonna talk to now at school
i know i’m laughing on the car ride home with you
don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day with you today
i have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother
inside and out he’s better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house
and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you
there is a video
i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen
and you’re talking to me
it’s the age of princesses and pirate ships
and the seven dwarves
and daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
in the whole wide world
now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
staying back and watching me shine
and i didn’t know if you knew
so i’m taking this chance to say
that i had the best day with you today

he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear and it's like
i couldn't ask for anything better
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you
he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
he's close to my mother
talks business with my father
he's charming and endearing
and i'm comfortable
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you
he can't see the smile i'm faking
and my heart's not breaking
'cause i'm not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating intoxicating complicated
got away by some mistake and now
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's and i'm cursing your name
i'm so in love that i acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you oh
and that's the way i loved you oh
never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you


they don't really have to be in a certain place or there at allthat’s how taylor
he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that’s a lie
just a boy in a chevy truck that had a tendency
of getting stuck on back roads at night
and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone but
when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me
september saw a month of tears and thanking god
that you weren’t here to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed is a letter that you never read
from three summers back
it’s hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
and looking back on all of that
it’s nice to believe
when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me
and i’m back for the first time since then
i’m standing on your street
and there’s a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that you’ll read
when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song
someday you’ll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mc graw i hope you think of me
oh think of me oooh
he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that’s a lie

say you're sorry
that face of an angel
comes out just when you need it to
as i paced back and forth all this time
'cause i honestly believed in you
holding on
the days drag on
stupid girl
i should have known i should have known
that i'm not a princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you
and your white horse to come around
maybe i was naive
got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
my mistake i didn't know to be in love
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i had so many dreams
about you and me
happy endings now i know
that i'm not a princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you
and your white horse to come around
and there you are on your knees
begging for forgiveness begging for me
just like i always wanted but i'm so sorry
'cause i'm not your princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
this is a big world that was a small town
there in my rearview mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now
oh whoa whoa whoa
try and catch me now
oh it's too late
to catch me now
you're on the phone with your girlfriend
shes going off about something that you said
'cuz she doesn't get your humor

and she'll never know your story

been here all along so why can't you
see you belong with
me you belong with me

laughing on a park bench thinking to myself

and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
i haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say you're fine
hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
she wears high heels

shes cheer captain and
i'm on the bleachers

a vision he did seeeth
fuckin' rockin' all the time
he wrote a tasty jam and all the planets did align
oh the dragons balls were blazin' as i stepped into his cave
then i sliced his fuckin' cockles
with a long and shiney blade
'twas i who fucked the dragon
fuckalize singfuckaloo
and if you try to fuck with me
then i shall fuck you too
gotta get it on in the party zone
i gots to shoot a load in the party zone
gotta lick a toad in the party zone
gotta suck a chode in the party zone
i wake up every evening
with a big smile on my face
and it never feels out of place
and you're still probably working
at a to pace
i wonder how bad that tastes
when you see my face
hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell
when you walk my way
hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell
now where's your picket fence love
and where's that shiny car
and did it ever get you far
you never seemed so tense love

do you know where you are
and truth be told i miss you
and truth be told i'm lying
when you see my face
hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell
when you walk my way
hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell
if you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
then he's a fool you're just as well
hope it gives you hell
i hope it gives you hell
tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
"where did it all go wrong"
but the list goes on and on
and truth be told i miss you
and truth be told i'm lying
when you see my face
hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell
when you walk my way

with the sad sad look
that you wear so well
when you see my face
hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell
when you walk my way

if you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
then he's a fool you're just as well

load the car and write the note
grab your bag and grab your coat
tell the ones that need to know
we are headed north
one foot in and one foot back
but it don't pay to live like that
so i cut the ties and i jumped the tracks
for never to return
aw brooklyn brooklyn take me in
are you aware the shape i'm in
my hands they shake my head it spins
aw brooklyn brooklyn take me in
when at first i learned to speak
i used all my words to fight
with him and her and you and me

like a pair of stolen polished dimes
she asked to dance i said it's fine aw it's fine

three words that became hard to say
i and love and you
i and love and you
i and love and you

what's wrong with the world mama
people livin' like they ain't got no mamas
i think the whole world addicted to the drama
only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
overseas yeah we try to stop terrorism
but we still got terrorists here livin'
in the usa the big cia
the bloods and the crips and the kkk
but if you only have love for your own race
then you only leave space to discriminate
and to discriminate only generates hate
and when you hate then you're bound to get irate yeah
badness is what you demonstrate
and that's exactly how anger works and operates
n' you gotta have love just to set it straight
take control of your mind and meditate
people killin' people dyin'
children hurt and you hear them cryin'
can you practice what you preach
and would you turn the other cheek
father father father help us
send us some guidance from above
'cause people got me got me questionin'
where is the love love
where is the love the love
where is the love the love
where is the love
the love the love
it just ain't the same always unchanged
new days are strange is the world insane
if love and peace is so strong
why are there pieces of love that don't belong
chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
with the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
so ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
so i could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
in this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
makin' wrong decisions only visions of them dividends
not respectin' each other deny thy brother
a war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
the truth is kept secret it's swept under the rug
if you never know truth then you never know love
where's the love y'all come on i don't know
where's the truth y'all come on i don't know
people killin' people dyin'
children hurt and you hear them cryin'
can you practice what you preach
and would you turn the other cheek
father father father help us
send us some guidance from above
'cause people got me got me questionin'
where is the love love
where is the love the love
where is the love the love
where is the love
the love the love
i feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
as i'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
most of us only care about money makin'
selfishness got us followin' in the wrong direction
wrong information always shown by the media
negative images is the main criteria
infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
yo' whatever happened to the values of humanity
whatever happened to the fairness in equality
instead in spreading love we spreading animosity
lack of understanding leading lives away from unity
that's the reason why sometimes i'm feelin' under
that's the reason why sometimes i'm feelin' down
there's no wonder why sometimes i'm feelin' under
where is the love
where is the love
where is the love
where is the love
father father father help us
send us some guidance from above
'cause people got me got me questionin'
where is the love
one world one world
one world one world
one world one world
and something's wrong with it
something's wrong with it
something's wrong with the wowoworld yeah
one world one world
one world one world
o holy night the stars are brightly shining
it is the night of the dear savior’s birth
long lay the world in sin and error pining
till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
a thrill of hopethe weary world rejoices
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
fall on your knees
o hear the angels' voices
o night divine
o night when christ was born
o night divine
o night when christ was born
led by the light of faith serenely beaming
with glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
so led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
here come the wise men from orient land
the king of kings lay thus in lowly manger
in all our trials born to be our friend
fall on your knees
o hear the angels' voices
o night divine
o night when christ was born
o night divine
o night o night divine
truly he taught us to love one another
his law is love and his gospel is peace
chains shall he break for the slave is our brother
and in his name all oppression shall cease
sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
let all within us praise his holy name
fall on your knees
o hear the angels' voices
o night divine
o night when christ was born
o night divine
o night o night divine

so lately you're wondering who will be there to take my place
when i'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
if a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
then between sand and stone could you make it on your own
if i could then i would i'll go wherever you will go
way up high or down low i'll go wherever you will go
and maybe i'll find out a way to make it back someday
to watch you to guide you through the darkest of your days
if a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
well then i hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you
if i could then i would i'll go wherever you will go
way up high or down low i'll go wherever you will go
run away with my heart
run away with my hope
run away with my love

there is a house built out of stone
wooden floors walls and window sills
tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
this is a place where i don't feel alone
this is a place where i feel at home
and i built a home for you for me
until it disappeared from me from you
and now it's time to live and turn to dust
out in the garden where we planted the seeds
there is a tree as old as me
branches were sewn by the color of green
ground had arose and passed it's knees
by the cracks of the skin i climbed to the top
i climbed the tree to see the world
when the gusts came around to blow me down
i held on as tightly as you held onto me
i held on as tightly as you held onto me
and i built a home for you for me
until it disappeared from me from you
and now it's time to live and turn to dust

well it's a big big city and it's always the same
can never be too pretty tell me your name
is it out of line if i was to be bold and say "would you be mine"
because i may be a beggar and you may be the queen
and though i may be on a downer i'm still ready to dream
though it's o'clock the time is just the time it takes for you to talk
so if you're lonely why'd you say you're not lonely
oh you're a silly girl i know i heard it so
it's just like you to come and go
and know me no you don't even know me
you're so sweet to try oh my you caught my eye
a girl like you's just irresistible
well it's a big big city and the lights are all out
but it's as much as i can do you know to figure you out
and i must confess my heart's all broken pieces
and my head's a mess
and it's in the morning and i'm walking along
beside the ghost of every drinker here who has ever done wrong
and it's you woo hoo
that's got me going crazy for the things you do
so if you're crazy i don't care you amaze me
but you're a stupid girl oh me oh my you talk
i die you smile you laugh i cry
and only a girl like you could be lonely
and it's a crying shame if you would think the same
a boy like me's just irresistible
so if you're lonely why'd you say you're not lonely
oh you're a silly girl i know i heard it so
it's just like you to come and go
and know me no you don't even know me
you're so sweet to try oh my you caught my eye
a girl like you's just irresistible
step one you say we need to talk
he walks you say sit down it’s just a talk
he smiles politely back at you
you stare politely right on through
some sort of window to your right
as he goes left and you stay right
between the lines of fear and blame
and you begin to wonder why you came
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
let him know that you know best
cause after all you do know best
try to slip past his defense
without granting innocence
lay down a list of what is wrong
the things you’ve told him all along
and pray to god he hears you
and pray to god he hears you
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
as he begins to raise his voice
you lower yours and grant him one last choice
drive until you lose the road
or break with the ones you’ve followed
he will do one of two things
he will admit to everything
or he’ll say he’s just not the same
and you’ll begin to wonder why you came
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
how to save a life
how to save a life
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
how to save a life
how to save a life

if i don't say this now i will surely break
as i'm leaving the one i want to take
forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait
my heart has started to separate
oh oh oh

oh oh oh
oh oh oh
be my baby
i'll look after you
there now steady love so few come and don't go

when i'm losing my control the city spins around
you're the only one who knows you slow it down
oh oh oh
oh oh oh
be my baby
oh oh oh
oh oh oh

be my baby
i'll look after you

i never knew
i never knew that everything was falling through
that everyone i knew was waiting on a queue
to turn and run when all i needed was the truth
but that's how it's got to be
it's coming down to nothing more than apathy
i'd rather run the other way than stay and see
the smoke and who's still standing when it clears
everyone knows i'm in
over my head over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
she's on your mind she's on your mind
let's rearrange
i wish you were a stranger i could disengage
to say that we agree and then never change
soften a bit until we all just get along
but that's disregard
you find another friend and you discard
as you lose the argument in a cable car
hanging above as the canyon comes between
everyone knows i'm in
over my head over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
she's on your mind she's on your mind
and suddenly i become a part of your past
i'm becoming the part that don't last
i'm losing you and its effortless
without a sound we lose sight of the ground
in the throw around
never thought that you wanted to bring it down
i won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves
everyone knows i'm in
over my head over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
she's on your mind she's on your mind
everyone knows she's on your mind
everyone knows i'm in over my head
my head i'm over my
everyone knows i'm in
over my head over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
she's on your mind she's on your mind
i found god on the corner of first and amistad
where the west was all but won
all alone smoking his last cigarette
i said where you been he said ask anything
where were you
when everything was falling apart
all my days were spent by the telephone
it never rang
and all i needed was a call
that never came
to the corner of first and amistad
lost and insecure you found me you found me
lying on the floor surrounded surrounded
whyd you have to wait where were you where were you
just a little late you found me you found me
in the end everyone ends up alone
losing her the only one whos ever known
who i am who im not who i want to be
no way to know how long she will be next to me
lost and insecure you found me you found me
lying on the floor surrounded surrounded
whyd you have to wait where were you where were you
just a little late you found me you found me
early morning city breaks
ive been calling for years and years and years and years
and you never left me no messages
you never send me no letters
you got some kind of nerve taking all i want
lost and insecure you found me you found me
lying on the floor where were you where were you
lost and insecure you found me you found me
lying on the floor surrounded surrounded
whyd you have to wait where were you where were you
just a little late you found me you found me
whyd you have to wait to find me to find me

from the dusty mesa
her looming shadow grows
hidden in the branches
of the poison creosote
she twines her spines up slowly
towards the boiling sun
and when i touched her skin
my fingers ran with blood
in the hushing dusk
under a swollen silver moon
i came walking with the wind
to watch the cactus bloom
a strange hunger haunted me
the looming shadows danced
i fell down to the thorny brush
and felt a trembling hand
when the last light warms the rocks
and the rattlesnakes unfold
mountain cats will come
to drag away your bones
and rise with me forever
across the silent sand
and the stars will be your eyes
and the winds will be my hands
when there's nowhere else to run
is there room for one more son
one more son
if you can hold on
if you can hold on hold on
i want to stand up i want to let go
you know you know no you don't you don't
i want to shine on in the hearts of men
another head aches another heart breaks
i'm so much older than i can take
and my affection well it comes and goes
help me out yeah
oh don't you put me on the back burner
you know you gotta help me out yeah
and when there's nowhere else to run
is there room for one more son
the coldhearted boy i used to be
yeah you know you gotta help me out yeah
oh don't you put me on the back burner
you know you gotta help me out yeah
you're gonna bring yourself down yeah
you're gonna bring yourself down yeah
you're gonna bring yourself down
i got soul but i'm not a soldier
i got soul but i'm not a soldier
i got soul but i'm not a soldier
i got soul but i'm not a soldier
i got soul but i'm not a soldier
yeah you know you gotta help me out yeah
oh don't you put me on the back burner
you know you gotta help me out yeah
you're gonna bring yourself down yeah
oh don't you put me on the back burner
you're gonna bring yourself down
over and in last call for sin
while everyone's lost the battle is won
with all these things that i've done
with all these things that i've done
if you can hold on if you can hold on
i did my best to notice when the call came down the line
up to the platform of surrender i was brought but i was kind
and sometimes i get nervous when i see an open door
close your eyes clear your heart
cut the cord are we human or are we dancer
my sign is vital my hands are cold
and i'm on my knees looking for the answer
are we human or are we dancer
pay my respects to grace and virtue send my condolences to good
give my regards to soul and romance they always did the best they could
and so long to devotion you taught me everything i know
wave goodbye wish me well
you got to let me go are we human or are we dancer
my sign is vital my hands are cold
and i'm on my knees looking for the answer
are we human or are we dancer
will your system be alright when you dream of home tonight
there is no message we're receiving let me know is your heart still beating
are we human or are we dancer
my sign is vital my hands are cold
and i'm on my knees looking for the answer
you got to let me know are we human or are we dancer
my sign is vital my hands are cold
and i'm on my knees looking for the answer
are we human
or are we dancer
are we human or are we dancer
are we human or are we dancer
coming out of my cage

now i'm falling asleep
and she's calling a cab
now they're going to bed
and my stomach is sick
сhest now
he takes off her dress now
let me go
i just can't look
it's killing me
and taking control
jealousy
turning saints into the sea
swimming through sick lullabies
choking on your alibis
but it's just the price i pay
destiny is calling me
open up my eager eyes
‘cause i'm mr brightside
i'm coming out of my cage
and i've been doing just fine

just tryin' to keep it in line
you say you wanna move on and
you say i'm falling behind
can you read my mind
can you read my mind
i never really gave up on
breakin' out of this twostar town
i got the green light i got a little fight
i'm gonna turn this thing around
can you read my mind
can you read my mind
the good old days the honest man
the restless heart the promised land
a subtle kiss that no one sees
a broken wrist and a big trapeze
oh well i don't mind if you don't mind
coz i don't shine if you don't shine
before you go can you read my mind
it’s funny how you just break down
waitin' on some sign
i pull up to the front of your driveway
with magic soakin' my spine
can you read my mind
can you read my mind
the teenage queen the loaded gun
the drop dead dream the chosen one
a southern drawl a world unseen
a city wall and a trampoline
oh well i don't mind if you don't mind
cause i don't shine if you don't shine
before you jump tell me what you
find when you read my mind
slippin’ in my faith until i fall
he never returned that call
woman open the door don't let it sting
i wanna breathe that fire again she said
i don't mind if you don't mind
cause i don't shine if you don't shine
put your back on me
put your back on me
put your back on me
the stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun
when you read my mind
breaking my back just to know your name
seventeen tracks and i've had it with this game
i'm breaking my back just to know your name
anything goes but don't blink you might miss
cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
bring it back down bring it back down tonight
never thought i'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

who looked like a girlfriend
that i had in february of last year

waiting on some beautiful boy to
to save you from your old ways
you play forgiveness

but he talks like a gentleman
like you imagined
when you were young
can we climb this mountain
i dont know
higher now than ever before
i know we can make it if we take it slow
let's take it easy
easy now watch it go
we're burning down the highway sky line
on the back of a hurricane
that started turning
when you were young
when you were young
and sometimes you close your eyes
and see the place where you used to live
when you were young
the say the devil's water it ain't so sweet
you don't have to drink right now
but you can dip your feet
every once in a little while
you sit there in your heartache
waiting on some beautiful boy to
to save you from your old ways
you play forgiveness
watch it now here he comes
he doesnt look a thing like jesus
but he talks like a gentleman
like you imagined
when you were young

give up on trying to save us
i hope we come up with a failsafe plot
to piss off the dumb few that forgave us
i hope the fences we mended
fall down beneath their own weight
and i hope we hang on past the last exit
i hope it's already too late
and i hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
someday burns down
and i hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
and i never come back to this town again
in my life i hope i lie
and tell everyone you were a good wife
and i hope you die
i hope we both die
i hope i cut myself shaving tomorrow
i hope it bleeds all day long
our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
we're pretty sure they're all wrong
i hope it stays dark forever
i hope the worst isn't over
and i hope you blink before i do
and i hope i never get sober
and i hope when you think of me years down the line
you can't find one good thing to say
and i'd hope that if i found the strength to walk out
you'd stay the hell out of my way
i am drowning there is no sign of land
you are coming down with me
hand in unlovable hand
and i hope you die
i hope we both die
i broke free on a saturday morning
i put the pedal to the floor
headed north on mills avenue
and listened to the engine roar
my broken house behind me and good things ahead
a girl named cathy wants a little of my time
six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
ahah listen to the engine whine
i am going to make it through this year
if it kills me
i am going to make it through this year
if it kills me
i played video games in a drunken haze
i was years young
hurt my knuckles punching the machines
the taste of scotch rich on my tongue
and then cathy showed up and we hung out
trading swigs from a bottle all bitter and clean
locking eyes holding hands
twin high maintenance machines
i am going to make it through this year
if it kills me
i am going to make it through this year
if it kills me
i drove home in the california dusk
i could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
pictured the look on my stepfather's face
ready for the bad things to come
i downshifted as i pulled into the driveway
the motor screaming out stuck in second gear
the scene ends badly as you might imagine
in a cavalcade of anger and fear
there will be feasting and dancing in jerusalem next year
i am going to make it through this year
if it kills me
i am going to make it through this year
if it kills me


when i see your smile
tears run down my face i can't replace
and now that i'm stronger i've figured out
how this world turns cold and breaks through my soul
and i know i'll find deep inside me i can be the one
i will never let you fall
i'll stand up with you forever
i'll be there for you through it all
even if saving you sends me to heaven
it's ok it's ok it's ok
seasons are changing
and waves are crashing
and stars are falling all for us
days grow longer and nights grow shorter
i can show you i'll be the one
i will never let you fall
i'll stand up with you forever
i'll be there for you through it all
even if saving you sends me to heaven
cuz you're my you're my my true love my whole heart
please don't throw that away
cuz i'm here for you
please don't walk away
please tell me you'll stay stay
use me as you will
pull my strings just for a thrill
and i know i'll be ok
though my skies are turning gray
i will never let you fall
i'll stand up with you forever
i'll be there for you through it all
even if saving you sends me to heaven
e||
so no one told you life was gonna be this way
you're job's a joke you're broke your love life's doa

when it hasn't been your day your week your month or even your year
but i'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour
i'll be there for you like i've been there before
i'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me too
you're still at bed at ten and work began at eight
you've burned your breakfast so far things are going great
your mother warned you there'd be days like these
but she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees
and i'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour
i'll be there for you like i've been there before
i'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me too
no one could ever know me no one could ever see me
seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me
some one to face the day with make it through all the rest with
someone i'll always laugh with
even at my worst i'm best with you yeah
it's like you're always stuck in second gear
when it hasn't been your day your week your month
i'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour
i'll be there for you like i've been there before
i'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me too
i'll be there for you
i'll be there for you
i'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me too
i'm still alive but i'm barely breathing
just prayin' to a god that i don't believe in
cos i got time while she got freedom
cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even
her best days will be some of my worst
she finally met a man that's gonna put her first
while i'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping

saying if you see this girl can you tell her where i am
some try to hand me money they don't understand
i'm not broke i'm just a broken hearted man
i know it makes no sense but what else can i do
how can i move on when i'm still in love with you
'cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth i can be
thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet
and you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
so i'm not moving
i'm not moving
policeman says son you can't stay here
i said there's someone i'm waiting for if it's a day a month a year
gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
if she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
'cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth i can be
thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet
and you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
so i'm not moving
i'm not moving
so i'm not moving
i'm not moving
so i'm not moving
i'm not moving
people talk about the guy
who's waiting on a girl
there are no holes in his shoes
but a big hole in his world
maybe i'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
and maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
and you'll come running to the corner
'cause you'll know it's just for you
i'm the man who can't be moved
'cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth i can be
thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet
and you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
so i'm not moving
i'm not moving
so i'm not moving
i'm not moving
so i'm not moving
i'm not moving
going back to the corner where i first saw you
gonna camp in my sleeping bag no i'm not gonna move
gold teeth and a curse for this town
were all in my mouth
only i don't know how they got out dear
turn me back into the pet
i was when we met
i was happier then with no mind set
and if you'd took to me like
a gull takes to the wind
well i'd jumped from my trees
and i'd have danced like the king of the eyesores
and the rest of our lives would've fared well
new slang when you notice the stripes
the dirt in your fries
hope it's right when you die
old and bony
dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
never should've called
but my head's to the wall
and i'm lonely
and if you'd took to me like
a gull takes to the wind
well i'd jumped from my trees
and i'd have danced like the king of the eyesores
and the rest of our lives would've fared well
c am g c hang and walk down to am
godspeed all the baker's at dawn
may they all cut their thumbs
and bleed into their buns
'till they melt away
i'm looking in on the good life
i might be doomed never to find
without a trust or flaming fields
am i too dumb to refine
and if you'd took to me like
well i'd have danced like the queen of the eyesores
and the rest of our lives would've fared well
c am g c hang and walk down to am

i said please don't slow me down
if i'm going too fast

yeah the night's not over
you're not trying hard enough

the wait is over
i'm now taking over
you're no longer laughing
i'm not drowning fast enough

"i thought i told you
this world is not for you"
the room is on fire as she's fixing her hair
"you sound so angry

fell in love with a girl
i fell in love once and almost completely
she's in love with the world
but sometimes these feelings
can be so misleading
e|
she turns and says are you alright
i said i must be fine cause my heart's still beating
come and kiss me by the riverside yeah
red hair with a curl
mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping
can't keep away from the girl
these two sides of my brain need to have a meeting
can't think of anything to do yeah
my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
she's just looking for something new yeah
it's repeated twice with ah ahhhaa ahhhhhh aaah etc sung over
can't think of anything to do yeah
my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
she's just looking for something new yeah
fell in love with a girl
i fell in love once and almost completely
she's in love with the world
but sometimes these feelings
can be so misleading
she turns and says are you alright
i said i must be fine cause my heart's still beating
come and kiss me by the riverside yeah
can't think of anything to do yeah
my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
she's just looking for something new yeah







i'm gonna fight 'em off
a seven nation army couldn't hold me back
they're gonna rip it off
taking their time right behind my back
and i'm talking to myself at night
because i can't forget
back and forth through my mind
behind a cigarette
and a message coming from my eyes says leave it alone
don't want to hear about it
every single one's got a story to tell
everyone knows about it
from the queen of england to the hounds of hell
and if i catch it coming back my way
i'm gonna serve it to you
and that ain't what you want to hear
but that's what i'll do
and a feeling coming from my bones says find a home
i'm going to wichita
far from this opera forever more
i'm going to work the straw
make the sweat drip out of every pore
and i'm bleeding and i'm bleeding and i'm bleeding
right before the lord
all the words are going to bleed from me
and i will think no more
and the stains coming from my blood tell me go back home
fall is here hear the yell
back to school ring the bell
brand new shoes walking blues
climb the fence books and pens
i can tell that we are gonna be friends
i can tell that we are gonna be friends
walk with me suzy lee
through the park and by the tree
we will rest upon the ground
and look at all the bugs we've found
safely walk to school without a sound
safely walk to school without a sound
here we are no one else
we walked to school all by ourselves
there's dirt on our uniforms
from chasing all the ants and worms
we clean up and now it's time to learn
we clean up and now it's time to learn
numbers letters learn to spell
nouns and books and show and tell
at playtime we will throw the ball
back to class through the hall
teacher marks our height against the wall
teacher marks our height against the wall
and we don't notice any time pass
we don't notice anything
we sit side by side in every class
teacher thinks that i sound funny
but she likes the way you sing
tonight i'll dream while i'm in bed
when silly thoughts go through my head
about the bugs and alphabet
and when i wake tomorrow i'll bet
that you and i will walk together again
i can tell that we are gonna be friends
cause i can tell that we are gonna be friends
what if i wanted to break
laugh it all off in your face
what would you do
what if i fell to the floor
couldn’t take this any…more
what would you do
comebreak me down
i am finished with you
what if i wanted to fight
beg for the rest of my life
what would you do
you say you wanted more
what are you waiting for
i'm notrunning from you
comebreak me down
i am finished with you
look in my eyes
all i wanted was you
i tried to be someone else
but nothing seemed to change
i know now this is who i really am inside
finally found myself
fighting for a chance
i know now this is who i really am
comebreak me down
i am finished with you
look in my eyes
all i wanted was you

every time we lie awake
after every hit we take
every feeling that i get
but i haven't missed you yet
every roommate kept awake
by every sigh and scream we make
all the feelings that i get
but i still don't miss you yet
only when i stop to think about it
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
every time we lie awake
after every hit we take
every feeling that i get
but i haven't missed you yet
only when i stop to think about it
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
only when i stop to think
about you i know
only when you stop to think
about me do you know
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
you hate everything about me
why do you love me
i hate
you hate
i hate
you love me
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
last chord hold it till the end
i don't know why i act the way i do
like i ain't got a single thing to lose
sometimes i'm my own worst enemy
i guess that's just the cowboy in me
i got a life that most would love to have
but sometimes i still wake up fightin' mad
at where this road i'm heading down might lead
i guess that's just the cowboy in me
the urge to run the restlessness
the heart of stone i sometimes get
the things i've done for foolish pride
the me that's never satisfied
the face that's in the mirror when i don't like what i see
i guess that's just the cowboy in me
girl i know there's times you must have thought
there ain't a line you've drawn i haven't crossed
but you set your mind to see this love on through
i guess that's just the cowboy in you
we ride and never worry about the fall
i guess that's just the cowboy in us all
i really like christmas
it’s sentimental i know but i just really like it
i’m i’m hardly religious
i’d rather break bread with dawkins than desmond tutu to be honest
and yes i have all of the usual objections to consumerism
to the commercialisation of an ancient religion
pressganged into selling playstations and beer
but i still really like it
i’m looking forward to christmas
though i’m not expecting a visit from jesus
i’ll be seeing my dad
my brother and sisters my gran and my mum
they’ll be drinking white wine in the sun
i’ll be seeing my dad
my brother and sisters my gran and my mum
they’ll be drinking white wine in the sun
i don’t go in for ancient wisdom
i don’t believe just ’cause ideas are tenacious it means that they’re worthy
i get freaked out by churches
some of the hymns that they sing have nice chords but the lyrics are dodgy
and yes i have all of the usual objections
to the miseducation of children who in taxexempt institutions
and to judge things as plain right or wrong
but i quite like the songs
i’m not expecting big presents
the old combination of socks jocks and chocolates is just fine by me
‘cause i’ll be seeing my dad
my brother and sisters my gran and my mum
they’ll be drinking white wine in the sun
i’ll be seeing my dad
my brother and sisters my gran and my mum
they’ll be drinking white wine in the sun
and you my baby girl
my jetlagged infant daughter
you’ll be handed round the room
like a puppy at a primary school
and you won't understand
but you will learn some day
that wherever you are and whatever you face
these are the people who’ll make you feel safe in this world
my sweet blueeyed girl
and if my baby girl
when you’re twentyone or thirtyone
and christmas comes around
and you find yourself nine thousand miles from home
you’ll know whatever comes
your brothers and sisters and me and your mum
will be waiting for you in the sun
whenever you come
your brothers and sisters your aunts and your uncles
your grandparents cousins and me and your mum
we’ll be waiting for you in the sun
drinking white wine in the sun
darling when xmas comes
we’ll be waiting for you in the sun
drinking white wine in the sun
waiting for you in the sun
waiting for you
wa iting
i really like christmas
it’s sentimental i know
it's a lesson too late for the learnin'
made of sand made of sand
in the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
in your hand in your hand
are you going away with no word of farewell
will there be not a trace left behind
well i could have loved you better
didn't mean to be unkind
you know that was the last thing on my mind
you've got reasons aplenty for goin'
this i know this i know
for the weeds have been steadily growin'
please don't go please don't go
are you going away with no word of farewell
will there be not a trace left behind
well i could have loved you better
didn't mean to be unkind
you know that was the last thing on my mind
as we walk on my thoughts keep tumblin'
round and round round and round
underneath our feet the subways rumblin'
underground underground
are you going away with no word of farewell
will there be not a trace left behind
well i could have loved you better
didn't mean to be unkind
you know that was the last thing on my mind
as i lie in my bed in the mornin'
without you without you
every song in my breast lies a bornin'
without you without you
are you going away with no word of farewell
will there be not a trace left behind
well i could have loved you better
didn't mean to be unkind
you know that was the last thing on my mind
we get it on most every night… when that moon is big and bright
it’s a supernatural delight… everybody’s dancing in the moonlight

they keep things loose they keep it tight everybody’s dancing in the
moonlight
dancing in the moonlight everybody’s feeling warm and bright
it’s such a fine and natural sight everybody’s dancing in the moonlight

you've stuck in a moment and now you can't get out if it
don't say that later will be better now you're stuck in a moment
and you can't get out of it
e||
i will not forsake
the colors that you bring
but the night you filled with fireworks
they left you with nothing
i am still enchanted
by the light you brought to me
i still listen through your ears
and through your eyes i can see
and you are such a fool
to worry like you do
i know it's tough
and you can never get enough
of what you don't really need nowmy oh my
you got to get yourself together
you've stuck in a moment
and now you can't get out if it
oh love look at you now
you've got yourself stuck in a moment
and you can't get out of it
i was unconscious half asleep
the water was warm until you discover how deep
i wasn't jumpingfor me it was a fall
it's a long way down to nothing at all
you got to get yourself together
you've stuck in a moment and now you can't get out if it
don't say that later will be better now you're stuck in a moment
and you can't get out of it
and if the night runs over
and if the day won't last
and if our way should falter
along the stony pass
and if the night runs over
and if the day won't last
and if our way should falter
along the stony pass
this time will pass

making my way downtown
walking fast
faces pass
and i'm home bound
staring blankly ahead
just making my way
making a way
through the crowd
'cause i need you
and i miss you
and now i wonder
if i could fall
into the sky
do you think time
would pass me by
'cause you know i'd walk
a thousand miles
just see you
tonight
it's always times like these
when i think of you
think of me
'cause everything's so wrong
and i don't belong
precious memories
'cause i need you
and i miss you
and now i wonder
if i could fall
into the sky
do you think time
would pass me by
'cause you know i'd walk
a thousand miles
just see you
tonight
and i i
don't want to let you know
i i
drown in your memory
i i
don't want to let this go
i i
don't
making my way downtown
walking fast
faces pass
and i'm home bound
staring blankly ahead
just making my way
making a way
through the crowd
'cause i still need you
and i still miss you
and now i wonder
if i could fall
into the sky
do you think time
would pass us by
'cause you know i'd walk
a thousand miles
just see you
if i could fall
into the sky
do you think time
would pass me by
'cause you know i'd walk
a thousand miles
just see you
just hold you
tonight

we'll run away together
we'll spend some time forever
we'll never feel bad anymore hip hip

jesus don't cry you can rely on me honey
you can combine anything you want
i'll be around you were right about the stars
each one is a setting sun
tall buildings shake voices escape singing sad sad songs
tuned to chords
strung down your cheeks bitter melodies turning your orbit around
don't cry you can rely on me honey
you can come by any time you want
i'll be around you were right about the stars
each one is a setting sun
tall buildings shake voices escape singing sad sad songs
tuned to chords
strung down your cheeks bitter melodies turning your orbit around
voices whine skyscrapers are scraping together
your voice is smoking
last cigarettes are all you can get turning your orbit around
our love our love
our love is all we have
our love our love is all of god's money
everyone is a burning sun
tall buildings shake voices escape singing sad sad songs
tuned to chords
strung down your cheeks bitter melodies turning your orbit around
voices whine skyscrapers are scraping together
your voice is smoking
last cigarettes are all you can get turning your orbit around
last cigarettes are all you can get turning your orbit around
last cigarettes are all you can get turning your orbit around
ich sehe was du denkst ich denke was du fühlst
ich fühle was du willst aber ich hör' dich nicht ich
hab' mir ein wörterbuch geliehen dir a bis z ins ohr geschrien
ich stapel tausend wirre worte auf die dich am ärmel ziehn
und wo du hingehen willst ich häng' an deinen beinen
wenn du schon auf den mund fallen musst warum dann nicht auf meinen
oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh
bitte gib mir nur ein bitte bitte gib mir nur ein oh
oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh
bitte gib mir nur ein bitte bitte gib mir nur ein wort
es ist verrückt wie schön du schweigst
wie du dein hübsches köpfchen neigst
und so der ganzen lauten welt und mir die kalte schulter zeigst
dein schweigen ist dein zelt du stellst es mitten in die welt
spannst die schnüre und staunst stumm
wenn nachts ein mädchen drüber fällt
zu deinen füssen red' ich mich um kopf und kragen
ich will in deine tiefen wasser große wellen schlagen
oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh
bitte gib mir nur ein bitte bitte gib mir nur ein oh
oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh
bitte gib mir nur ein bitte bitte gib mir nur ein wort
in meinem blut werfen die endorphine blasen
wenn hinter deinen stillen hasenaugen die gedanken rasen
oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh
bitte gib mir nur ein bitte bitte gib mir nur ein oh
oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh bitte gib mir nur ein oh
bitte gib mir nur ein bitte bitte gib mir nur ein wort

you know i like my chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i was raised up beneath the shade of a georgia pine
and that`s home you know
sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
where the peaches grow
and my house it`s not much to talk about
but it`s filled with love that`s grown in southern ground
and a little bit of chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i`ve seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman`s eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother`s love
well it`s funny how it`s the little things in life that mean the most
not where you live or the car you drive or the price tag on your clothes
there`s no dollar sign on a peace of mind this i`ve come to know
so if you agree have a drink with me
raise your glasses for a toast
to a little bit of chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i`ve seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman`s eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother`s love
i thank god for my life
and for the stars and stripes
may freedom forever fly let it ring
salute the ones who died
the ones that give their lives so we don`t have to sacrifice
all the things we love
like our chicken fried
and cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i`ve seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman`s eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother`s love
getcha little chicken fried
a cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i`ve seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman`s eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother`s love
i got my toes in the water
ass in the sand
not a worry in the world
a cold beer in my hand
life is good today
life is good today
well the plane touched down
just about o'clock
and the city's still on my mind
bikinis palm trees danced in my head
i was still in the baggage line
concrete and cars are their own prison bars
like this life i'm livin in
but the plane brought me farther
i'm surrounded by water
and i'm not going back again
i got my toes in the water
ass in the sand
not a worry in the world
a cold beer in my hand
life is good today
life is good today
adios and vaya con dios
yea i'm leavin ga
and if it weren't for tequila pretty señoritas
i'd have no reason to stay
adios and vaya con dios
yea i'm leavin ga
gonna lay in the hot sun
roll a big fat one
grab my guitar play
the days flew by
like a drunk friday night
as the summer drew to an end
they can't believe that i just couldn't leave
and i bid adieu to my friends
cuz my bartender
she's from the islands
her body's been kissed by the sun
coconut replaces the smell of the bar
i don't know if it's her or the rum
i got my toes in the water
ass in the sand
not a worry in the world
a cold beer in my hand
life is good today
life is good today
adios and vaya con dios
a long way from ga
hey and all the muchachas they call me big papa
when i throw pesos their way
adios and vaya con dios
a long way from ga
hey boss do me a favor
pass me the jäger
i'll grab my guitar play
adios and vaya con dios
goin home now to stay
cuz señoritas don't careoh
i got no money to stay
adios and vaya con dios
goin home now to stay
i'm just gonna drive up by the lake
and put my ass in a lawn chair
toes in the clay
not a worry in the world
a pbr on the way
life is good today
life is good today
