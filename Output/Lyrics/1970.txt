it's just a silly phase i'm going through
and just because i call you up
don't get me wrong don't think you've got it made
i'm not in love nono
it's because
i like to see you but then again
that doesn't mean you mean that much to me
don't tell your friends about the two of us
i'm not in love nono
it's because
big boys don't cry
i keep your picture upon the wall
it hides a nasty stain that's lyin' there
i know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
i'm not in love nono
it's because
ooh you'll wait a long time for me
ooh you'll wait a long time
ooh you'll wait a long time for me

chiquitita tell me what s wrong
you're enchained by your own sorrow
in your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
how i hate to see you like this
there is no way you can deny it
i can see that you're oh so sad so quiet
chiquitita tell me the truth
i'm a shoulder you can cry on
your best friend i'm the one you must rely on
you were always sure of yourself
now i see you've broken a feather
i hope we can patch it up together
chiquitita you and i know
how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
you'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
you will have no time for grieving
chiquitita you and i cry
but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
let me hear you sing once more like you did before
sing a new song chiquitita
try once more like you did before
sing a new song chiquitita
so the walls came tumbling down
and your loves a blown out candle
all is gone and it seems too hard to handle
chiquitita tell me the truth
there is no way you can deny it
i can see that you re oh so sad so quiet
chiquitita you and i know
how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
you'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
you will have no time for grieving
chiquitita you and i cry
but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
let me hear you sing once more like you did before
sing a new song chiquitita
try once more like you did before
sing a new song chiquitita
try once more like you did before
sing a new song chiquitita

i have a dream a song to sing
to help me cope with anything
if you see the wonder of a fairy tale
you can take the future even if you fail
i believe in angels
something good in everything i see
i believe in angels
when i know the time is right for me
i'll cross the stream
i have a dream
i have a dream a fantasy
to help me through reality
and my destination makes it worth the while
pushing through the darkness still another mile
i believe in angels
something good in everything i see
i believe in angels
when i know the time is right for me
i'll cross the stream
i have a dream
i have a dream a song to sing
to help me cope with anything
if you see the wonder of a fairy tale
you can take the future even if you fail
i believe in angels
something good in everything i see
i believe in angels
when i know the time is right for me
i'll cross the stream
i have a dream
i'll cross the stream
i have a dream
i've been cheated by you since i don't know when
so i made up my mind it must come to an end
look at me now will i ever learn
i don't know how but i suddenly lose control
there's a fire within my soul
just one look and i can hear a bell ring
one more look and i forget everything
mamma mia here i go again
my my how can i resist you
mamma mia does it show again
my my just how much i've missed you
yes i've been brokenhearted
blue since the day we parted
why why did i ever let you go
mamma mia now i really know
my my i could never let you go
i've been angry and sad about the things that you do
i can't count all the times that i've told you we're through
and when you go when you slam the door
i think you know that you won't be away too long
you know that i'm not that strong
just one look and i can hear a bell ring
one more look and i forget everything
mamma mia here i go again
my my how can i resist you
mamma mia does it show again
my my just how much i've missed you
yes i've been brokenhearted
blue since the day we parted

where are those happy days they seem so hard to find
i try to reach for you but you have closed your mind
whatever happened to our love
i wish i understood
it used to be so nice it used to be so good
so when you're near me darling can't you hear me sos
the love you gave me nothing less can save me sos
when you're gone how can i even try to go on
when you're gone though i try how can i carry on
you seem so far away though you are standing near
you make me feel alive but something died i fear
i really tried to make it up i wish i understood
what happened to our love it used to be so good
so when you're near me darling can't you hear me sos
the love you gave me nothing less can save me sos
when you're gone how can i even try to go on
when you're gone though i try how can i carry on
so when you're near me darling can't you hear me sos
the love you gave me nothing less can save me sos
when you're gone how can i even try to go on
when you're gone though i try how can i carry on
when you're gone how can i even try to go on
when you're gone though i try how can i carry on
i'm nothing special in fact i'm a bit of a bore
if i tell a joke you've probably heard it before
but i have a talent a wonderful thing 'cause
ev'ryone listens when i start to sing
i'm so grateful and proud
all i want is to sing it out loud
so i say thank you for the music the songs i'm singing
thanks for all the joy they're bringing
who can live without it
i ask in all honesty what would life be
so i say thank you for the music for giving it to me
mother says i was a dancer before i could walk
she says i began to sing long before i could talk
and i’ve often wondered how did it all start
who found out that nothing could capture her heart
like a melody can
well whoever it was i’m a fan
i've been so lucky i am the girl with golden hair
i wanna sing it out to ev'rybody
what a joy what a life what a chance
so i say thank you for the music for giving it to me
so i say thank you for the music for giving it to me

i don't wanna talk
about things we've gone through
though it's hurting me
now it's history
i've played all my cards
and that's what you've done too
nothing more to say
no more ace to play
the winner takes it all
the loser standing small
beside the victory
that's her destiny
i was in your arms
thinking i belonged there
i figured it made sense
building me a fence
building me a home
thinking i'd be strong there
but i was a fool
playing by the rules
the gods may throw a dice
their minds as cold as ice
and someone way down here
loses someone dear
the winner takes it all
the loser has to fall
it's simple and it's plain
why should i complain
but tell me does she kiss
like i used to kiss you
does it feel the same
when she calls your name
somewhere deep inside
you must know i miss you
but what can i say
rules must be obeyed
the judges will decide
the likes of me abide
spectators of the show
always staying low
the game is on again
a lover or a friend
a big thing or a small
the winner takes it all
i don't wanna talk
if it makes you feel sad
and i understand
you've come to shake my hand
i apologize
if it makes you feel bad
seeing me so tense
no selfconfidence but you see …z
the winner takes it all
the winner takes it all
so the winner takes it a all
and the loser has to fall
throw a diice cold as ice
way down here someone dear
takes it aall has to fall
it seems plain to me

my my at waterloo napoleon did surrender
oh yeah and i have met my destiny in quite a similar way
the history book on the shelf
is always repeating itself
waterloo i was defeated you won the war
waterloo promise to love you for ever more
waterloo couldn't escape if i wanted to
waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
wowowo wowo waterloo finally facing my waterloo
my my i tried to hold you back but you were stronger
oh yeah and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
and how could i ever refuse
i feel like i win when i lose
waterloo i was defeated you won the war
waterloo promise to love you for ever more
waterloo couldn't escape if i wanted to
waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
wowowo wowo waterloo finally facing my waterloo so how

staying around you is all i see here's what i want us to do
let's we oughta stay together
loving you whether whether
times are good or bad happy or sad
on a morning from a bogart movie
in a country where they turned back time
you go strolling through the crowd like
peter lorre contemplating a crime
she comes out of the sun in a silk dress
running like a water color in the rain
don't bother asking for explanations
she'll just tell you that she came
she doesn't give you time for questions
as she locks up you arm in hers
and you follow 'til your sense of
which direction completely disappears
by the bluetiled walls near the market stalls
there's a hidden door she leads you to
"these days" she says "i feel my life just
like a river running through
well she looks at you so cooly
and her eyes shine like the moon
she comes in incense and pathchouli
so you take her to find what's
waiting inside
well morning comes and you're still with her
and the bus and the tourists are gone
and you've thrown away your choice and
lost your ticket so you have to stay on
but the drumbeat strains of the night
remain in the rhythm of the newborn day
you know sometime you're bound to leave her
but for now you're gonna stay
got on a board a westbound seven forty seven
didn't think before deciding what to do
all that talk of opportunities tv breaks and movies
rang true sure rang true
seems it never rains in southern california
seems i've often heard that kind of talk before
it never rains in california
but girls don't they warn ya
it pours man it pours
out of work i'm out of my head
out of self respect i'm out of bread
i'm under loved i'm under fed
i wanna go home
it never rains in california
but girls don't they warn ya
it pours man it pours
will you tell the folks back home i nearly made it
had offers but don't know which one to take
please don't tell them how you found me
don't tell them how you found me
give me a break give me a break
seems it never rains in southern california
seems i've often heard that kind of talk before
it never rains in california
but girls don't they warn ya
it pours man it pours
your cruel device your blood like ice
one look could kill my pain your thrill
i wanna love you but i better not touch
i wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
i wanna kiss you but i want it too much
i wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
you're poison running through my veins you're poison
i don't wanna break these chains
your mouth so hot your web i'm caught
your skin so wet black lace on sweat
i hear you calling and it's needles and pins
i wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin
i wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
you're poison running through my veins you're poison
i don't wanna break these chains you're poison
one look could kill my pain your thrill
i wanna love you but i better not touch
i wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
i wanna kiss you but i want it too much
i wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
you're poison running through my veins you're poison
i don't wanna break these chains poison
i wanna love you but i better not touch
i wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
i wanna kiss you but i want it too much
i wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
you're poison running through my veins you're poison
i don't wanna break these chains
on the first part of the journey
i was looking at all the life
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there were sand and hills and rings
the first thing i met was a fly with a buzz
and the sky with no clouds
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
but the air was full of sound
i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
la la la lala la la la la la
la la la lala la la la la la
after two days in the desert sun
my skin began to turn red
after three days in the desert fun
i was looking at a river bed
and the story it told of a river that flowed
made me sad to think it was dead
you see i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
la la la lala la la la la la
la la la lala la la la la la
after nine days i let the horse run free
'cause the desert had turned to sea
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there were sand and hills and rings
the ocean is a desert with its life underground
and a perfect disguise above
under the cities lies a heart made of ground
but the humans will give no love
you see i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
la la la lala la la la la la
la la la lala la la la la la
la la la lala la la la la la
la la la lala la la la la la
la la la lala la la la la la
la la la lala la la la la la
la la la lala la la la la la
la la la lala la la la la la
well i tried to make it sunday but i got so damn depressed
that i set my sights on monday and i got myself undressed
i ain't ready for the altar but i do agree there's times
when a woman sure can be a friend of mine
well i keep on thinkin' 'bout you sister golden hair surprise
and i just can't live without you can't you see it in my eyes
i been one poor correspondent and i been too too hard to find
but it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind
will you meet me in the middle will you meet me in the air
will you love me just a little just enough to show you care
well i tried to fake it i don't mind sayin' i just can't make it
well i keep on thinkin' 'bout you sister golden hair surprise
and i just can't live without you can't you see it in my eyes
i been one poor correspondent and i been too too hard to find
but it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind

riding on the city of new orleans
illinois central monday morning rail
fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
three conductors and twentyfive sacks of mail
all along the south bound odyssey the train pulls out of kankakee
rolls along past houses farms and fields
passing trains that have no name freight yards full of old black men
and the graveyards of the rusted automobiles
good morning america how are you
say don't you know me i'm your native son
i'm the train they call the city of new orleans
i'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
dealing card games with the old men in the club car
penny a point ain't no one keeping score
pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
and the sons of pullman porters and the sons of engineers
ride their fathers' magic carpets made of steel
mothers with their babes asleep rockin' to the gentle beat
and the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
good morning america how are you
say don't you know me i'm your native son
i'm the train they call the city of new orleans
i'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
night time on the city of new orleans
changing cars in memphis tennessee
halfway home we'll be there by morning
through the mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
but all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
and the steel rail still ain't heard the news
the conductor sings his songs again the passengers will please refrain
this train got the disappearing railroad blues
good night america how are you
say don't you know me i'm your native son
i'm the train they call the city of new orleans
i'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
guess i got what i deserve kept you waiting there too long my love
all that time without a word did't know you'd think that i'd forget
or i´d regret the special love i have for you my baby blue
all the days became so long did you really think i'd do you wrong
dixie when i let you go thought you'd realized i would know
i would show the special love i have for you my baby blue
what can i do what can i say except i want you by my side
how can i show you show me a way
don't you know the times i´ve tried
guess that's all i have to say except the feeling just grows stronger every day
just one thing before i go take good care baby let me know
let it flow the special love you've had for me my dixie dear
valley's deep and the mountain's so high
if you want to see god you've got to move on the other side
you stand up there with your head in the clouds
don't try to fly you know you might not come down
don't try to fly near god
you might not come down
jesus came down from heaven to earth
the people said it was a virgin birth
jesus came down from heaven to earth
the people said it was a virgin birth
the people said it was
a virgin birth
he told great stories of the lord
and said he was the saviour of us all
he told great stories of the lord
and said he was the saviour of us all
and said he was the saviour
of us all
for this we killed him nailed him up high
he rose again as if to ask us why
then he ascended into the sky
as if to say in god alone you soar
as if to say in god
alone we fly
valley's deep and the mountain's so high
if you want to see god you've got to move on the other side
you stand up there with your head in the clouds
don't try to fly you know you might not come down
don't try to fly near god
you might not come down
valley's deep and the mountain's so high
if you want to see god you've got to move on the other side
you stand up there with your head in the clouds
don't try to fly you know you might not come down
don't try to fly near god

if i was a flower growing wild and free
all i'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee
and if i was a tree growing tall and green
all i'd want is you to shade me and be my leaves
all i want is you will you be my bride
take me by the hand and stand by my side
all i want is you will you stay with me
hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea
if you were a river in the mountains tall
the rumble of your water would be my call
if you were the winter i know i'd be the snow
just as long as you were with me let the cold winds blow
all i want is you will you be my bride
take me by the hand and stand by my side
all i want is you will you stay with me
hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea
if you were a wink i'd be a nod
if you were a seed well i'd be a pod
if you were the floor i'd wanna be the rug
and if you were a kiss i know i'd be a hug
all i want is you will you be my bride
take me by the hand and stand by my side
all i want is you will you stay with me
hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea
if you were the wood i'd be the fire
if you were the love i'd be the desire
if you were a castle i'd be your moat
and if you were an ocean i'd learn to float
all i want is you will you be my bride
take me by the hand and stand by my side
all i want is you will you stay with me
hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea
i know your eyes in the morning sun
i feel you touch me in the pouring rain
and the moment that you wander far from me
i wanna feel you in my arms again
then you come to me on a summer breeze
keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
and it's me you need to show
how deep is your love
how deep is your love how deep is your love
i really mean to learn
'cause we're living in a world of fools breaking us down
when they all should let us be we belong to you and me
i believe in you
you know the door to my very soul
you're the light in my deepest darkest hour
you're my saviour when i fall
and you may not think i care for you
when you know down inside that i really do
and it's me you need to show

and harder to climb
you and me girl
got a highway to the sky
we can turn away
from the night or day
and the tears we had to cry
you're my life
i can see a new tomorrow
everything we own will never die
love is such a beautiful thing
when you are to me the light above
made for all to see our precious love

there's a reason for the sunshine sky
must be the season when that love light shines
all around us
so let that feeling grab you deep inside
and then go stealing through the moonlit nights
with your lover
just let your love flow like a mountain stream
and let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
and let your love show and you'll know what i mean
it's the season
let your love fly like a bird on the wing
and let your love bind you to all living things
and let your love shine and you'll know what i mean
that's the reason
there's a reason for the warm sweet nights
must be the season when those love lights shine
all around us
so let that wonder take you into space
just feel the thunder as it warms your face
you can't hold back
just let your love flow like a mountain stream
and let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
and let your love show and you'll know what i mean
it's the season
let your love fly like a bird on the wing
and let your love bind you to all living things
and let your love shine and you'll know what i mean
that's the reason
just let your love flow like a mountain stream
and let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
and let your love show and you'll know what i mean
it's the season
let your love fly like a bird on the wing
and let your love bind you to all living things
and let your love shine and you'll know what i mean
that's the reason
some say love it is a river
that drowns the tender reed
some say love it is a razor
that leaves your soul to bleed
some say love it is a hunger
an endless aching need
i say love it is a flower and
you its only seed
it's the heart afraid of breaking
that never learns to dance
it's the dream afraid of waking
that never takes the chance
it's the one who won't be taken
who cannot seem to give
and the soul afraid of dying
that never learns to live
when the night has been too lonely
and the road has been too long
and you think that love is only
for the lucky and the strong
just remember in the winter
far beneath the bitter snow
lies the seed that with the sun's love
in the spring becomes the rose
||
||
won't you let me walk you home from school
won't you let me meet you at the pooooooool
maybe friday i can
get tickets for the dance
and i'll taaaaaaaaaake you
won't you tell your dad get off my back
tell him what we said 'bout 'paint it black'
rock 'n roll is here to stay
come inside where it's okay
and i'll shaaaaaaaaaake you
won't you tell me what you're thinking of
would you be an outlaw for my love
if it's so well let me know
if it's no well i can go
i won't maaaaaaaaaaake you
jesus jesus jesus
there's just something about that name
master saviour jesus
like the fragrance after the rain
jesus jesus jesus
let all heaven and earth proclaim
kings and kingdoms
will all pass away
but there's something about that name
ain't no sunshine when she's gone
it's not warm when she's away
ain't no sunshine when she's gone and she's always gone too long
anytime she goes away
wonder this time where she's gone
wonder if she's gone to stay
ain't no sunshine when she's gone and this house just ain't no home
anytime she goes away
but ain't no sunshine when she's gone
but ain't no sunshine when she's gone
only darkness everyday
ain't no sunshine when she's gone and this house just ain't no home
anytime she goes away
anytime she goes away
anytime she goes away
anytime she goes away
sometimes in our lives
we all have pain
we all have sorrow
but if we are wise
we know that there's always tomorrow
lean on me when you're not strong
and i'll be your friend
i'll help you carry on
for it won't be long
'til i'm gonna need
somebody to lean on
please swallow your pride
if i have things
you need to borrow
for no one can fill
those of your needs
that you won't let show
so just call on me brother when you need a hand
we all need somebody to lean on
i just might have a problem that you'd understand
we all need somebody to lean on

somebody to lean on

she can kill with a smile
she can wound with her eyes
she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
and she only reveals what she wants you to see
she hides like a child
but shes always a woman to me
she can lead you to love
she can take you or leave you
she can ask for the truth
but she'll never believe
and shell take what you give her as long as its free
she steals like a thief
but shes always a woman to me
ohhh she takes care of herself
she can wait if she wants
shes ahead of her time
ohhh and she never gives out
and she never gives in
she just changes her mind
and she'll promise you more
than the garden of eden
then she'll carelessly cut you
and laugh while you're bleedin'
but she'll bring out the best
and the worst you can be
blame it all on yourself
cause shes always a woman to me
ohhh she takes care of herself
she can wait if she wants
shes ahead of her time
ohhh and she never gives out
and she never gives in
she just changes her mind
she is frequently kind
and she's suddenly cruel
she can do as she pleases
shes nobody's fool
but she cant be convicted
she's earned her degree
and the most she will do
is throw shadows at you
but shes always a woman to me
slow down you crazy child
you're so ambitious for a juvenile
but then if you're so smart tell me why
you are still so afraid
where's the fire what's the hurry about

you got so much to do and only
so many hours in a day
but you know that when the truth is told
that you can get what you want
or you can just get old
you're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through oooo
when will you realize
vienna waits for you
slow down you're doing fine
you can't be everything you want to be
before your time
although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight tonight
too bad but it's the life you lead
you're so ahead of yourself
that you forgot what you need
though you can see when you're wrong
you know you can't always see when you're right you're right
you got your passion you got your pride
but don't you know that only fools are satisfied
dream on but don't imagine they'll all come true ooo
when will you realize
vienna waits for you
slow down you crazy child
take the phone off the hook
and disappear for a while
it's alright you can afford to lose a day or two oooo
when will you realize
vienna waits for you
and you know that when the truth is told
that you can get what you want
or you can just get old
you're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through oooo
why don't you realize
vienna waits for you

i am iron man
has he lost his mind
can he see or is he blind
can he walk at all
or if he moves will he fall
is he alive or dead
has he thoughts within his head
we'll just pass him there
why should we even care
he was turned to steel
in the great magnetic field
when he traveled time
for the future of mankind
nobody wants him
he just stares at the world
planning his vengeance
that he will soon unfurl
now the time is here
for iron man to spread fear
vengeance from the grave
kills the people he once saved
nobody wants him
they just turn their heads
nobody helps him
now he has his revenge
heavy boots of lead
fills his victims full of dread
running as fast as they can
iron man lives again
finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think i'm insane because i am frowning all the time
all day long i think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
think i'll lose my mind if i don't find something to pacify
can you help me
occupy my brain
oh yeah
i need someone to show me the things in life that i can't find
i can't see the things that make true happiness i must be blind
make a joke and i will sigh and you will laugh and i will cry
happiness i cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
and so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
i tell you to enjoy life i wish i could but it's too late
generals gathered in their masses just like witches at black masses
evil minds that plot destruction sorcerer of death's construction
in the fields the bodies burning as the war machine keeps turning
death and hatred to mankind poisoning their brainwashed minds
oh lord yeah
politicians hide themselves away they only started the war
they leave that role to the poor yeah
time will tell on their power minds making war just for fun
wait 'till their judgement day comes yeah
now in darkness world stops turning ashes where the bodies burning
no more war pigs have the power hand of god has struck the hour
day of judgement god is calling on their knees the war pigs crawling
begging mercies for their sins satan laughing spreads his wings
oh lord yeah

sad songs for us to bear
you know sometimes i write happy songs
but then sometimes little things are wrong
you know i wish they all could make you smile
tomorrow maybe we can get away

pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
enter patty valentine from the upper hall
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood
cries out "my god they killed them all"
here comes the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell but one time
he could have been the champion of the world
three bodies lyin’ there does patty see
and another man named bello movin’ around mysteriously
“i didn’t do it” he says and he throws up his hands
“i was only robbin’ the register i hope you understand
i saw them leavin’” he says and he stops
“one of us had better call up the cops”
and so patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’
in the hot new jersey night
meanwhile far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that
in paterson that’s just the way things go
if you’re black you might as well not show up on the street
’less you wanna draw the heat
alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowlin’ around
he said “i saw two men runnin’ out they looked like middleweights
they jumped into a white car with outofstate plates”
and miss patty valentine just nodded her head
cop said “wait a minute boys this one’s not dead”
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men
four in the mornin’ and they haul rubin in
take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
the wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eye
says “wha’d you bring him in here for he ain’t the guy”
yes here’s the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for somethin’ that he never done
put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been
the champion of the world
four months later the ghettos are in flame
rubin’s in south america fightin’ for his name
while arthur dexter bradley’s still in the robbery game
and the cops are puttin’ the screws to him lookin’ for somebody to blame
“remember that murder that happened in a bar”
“remember you said you saw the getaway car”
“you think you’d like to play ball with the law”
“think it mighta been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night”
“don’t forget that you are white”
arthur dexter bradley said “i’m really not sure”
cops said “a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend bello
now you don’t wanta have to go back to jail be a nice fellow
you’ll be doin’ society a favor
that sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder on him
he ain’t no gentleman jim”
rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much
it’s my work he’d say and i do it for pay
and when it’s over i’d just as soon go on my way
up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jailhouse
where they try to turn a man into a mouse
all of rubin’s cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pigcircus he never had a chance
the judge made rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
and though they could not produce the gun
the da said he was the one who did the deed
and the allwhite jury agreed
rubin carter was falsely tried
the crime was murder “one” guess who testified
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers they all went along for the ride
how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fool’s hand
to see him obviously framed
couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
where justice is a game
now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha in a tenfoot cell
an innocent man in a living hell
that’s the story of the hurricane
but it won’t be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time he’s done
put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been
the champion of the world
they say everything can be replaced
yet every distance is not near
so i remember every face
of every man who put me here
i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east
any day now
any day now
i shall be released
they say every man needs protection
they say that every man must fall
yet i swear i see my reflection
someplace so high above this wall
i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east
any day now
any day now
i shall be released
well yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
a man who swears he's not to blame
all day long i hear him cry out so loud
calling out that he's been framed
i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east
any day now
any day now
i shall be released
mama take this badge off of me
i can't use it anymore
it's getting dark too dark to see
i feel i'm knockin on heaven's door
knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
mama put my guns in the ground
i can't shoot them anymore
that long black cloud is comin' down
i feel i'm knockin' on heaven's door
knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
oo oo oo oo
your breath is sweet your eyes are like
two jewels in the sky
your back is straight your hair is smooth
on the pillow where you lie
but i don't sense affection
no gratitude or love
your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above
one more cup of coffee for the road
one more cup of coffee 'fore i go
to the valley below
your daddy he's an outlaw
and a wanderer by trade
he'll teach you how to pick an choose
and how to throw the blade
and he oversees his kingdom
so no stranger does intrude
his voice it trembles as he calls out
for another plate of food
one more cup of coffee for the road
one more cup of coffee 'fore i go
to the valley below
your sister sees the future
like your momma and yourself
you've never learned to read or write
there's no books upon your shelf
and your pleasure knows no limits
your voice is like a meadow larks
but your heart is like an ocean
mysterious and dark
one more cup of coffee for the road
one more cup of coffee 'fore i go
to the valley below
'twas in another lifetime one of toil and blood
when blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud
i came in from the wilderness a creature void of form
come in she said i'll give ya shelter from the storm
and if i pass this way again you can rest assured
i'll always do my best for her on that i give my word
in a world of steeleyed death and men who are fighting to be warm
come in she said i'll give ya shelter from the storm
not a word was spoke between us there was little risk involved
everything up to that point had been left unresolved
try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
come in she said i'll give ya shelter from the storm
i was burned out from exhaustion buried in the hail
poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail
hunted like a crocodile ravaged in the corn
come in she said i'll give ya shelter from the storm
suddenly i turned around and she was standing there
with silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
she walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
come in she said i'll give ya shelter from the storm
now there's a wall between us somethin' there's been lost
i took too much for granted got my signals crossed
just to think that it all began on a long forgotten morn
come in she said i'll give you shelter from the storm
well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
but nothing really matters much it's doom alone that counts
and the oneeyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
come in she said i'll give you shelter from the storm
i've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
and old men with broken teeth stranded without love
do i understand your question then is it hopeless and forlorn
come in she said i'll give you shelter from the storm
in a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes
i bargained for salvation and they gave me a lethal dose
i offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
come in she said i'll give you shelter from the storm
well i'm livin' in a foreign country but i'm bound to cross the line
beauty walks a razor's edge someday i'll make it mine
if i could only turn back the clock to when god and her were born
come in she said i'll give you shelter from the storm
they sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark
she looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
it was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
and watched out for a simple twist of fate
they walked along by the old canal a little confused i remember well
and stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright
he felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
moving with a simple twist of fate
a saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade
as the light bust through a beatup shade where he was waking up
she dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
and forgot about his simple twist of fate
no lyrics harmonica solo
no lyrics harmonica solo
he woke up the room was bare he didn't see her anywhere
he told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide
felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
brought on by a simple twist of fate
he hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks
hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
maybe she'll pick him out again how long must he wait
one more time for a simple twist of fate
people tell me its a sin to know and feel too much within
i still believe she was my twin but i lost the ring
she was born in spring but i was born too late
blame it on a simple twist of fate
no lyrics harmonica solo
no lyrics harmonica solo
early one mornin' the sun was shinin'
i was layin' in bed
wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
if her hair was still red
her folks they said our lives together
sure was gonna be rough
they never did like mama's homemade dress
papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
and i was standin' on the side of the road
rain fallin' on my shoes
heading out for the east coast
lord knows i've paid some dues gettin' through
tangled up in blue
she was married when we first met
soon to be divorced
i helped her out of a jam i guess
but i used a little too much force
we drove that car as far as we could
abandoned it out west
split up on a dark sad night
both agreeing it was best
she turned around to look at me
as i was walkin' away
i heard her say over my shoulder
"we'll meet again someday on the avenue"
tangled up in blue
i had a job in the great north woods
working as a cook for a spell
but i never did like it all that much
and one day the ax just fell
so i drifted down to new orleans
where i happened to be employed
workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
right outside of delacroix
but all the while i was alone
the past was close behind
i seen a lot of women
but she never escaped my mind and i just grew
tangled up in blue
she was workin' in a topless place
and i stopped in for a beer
i just kept lookin' at the side of her face
in the spotlight so clear
and later on as the crowd thinned out
i's just about to do the same
she was standing there in back of my chair
said to me "don't i know your name"
i muttered somethin' underneath my breath
she studied the lines on my face
i must admit i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
tangled up in blue
she lit a burner on the stove
and offered me a pipe
"i thought you'd never say hello" she said
"you look like the silent type"
then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
and every one of them words rang true
and glowed like burnin' coal
pourin' off of every page
like it was written in my soul from me to you
tangled up in blue
i lived with them on montague street
in a basement down the stairs
there was music in the cafes at night
and revolution in the air
then he started into dealing with slaves
and something inside of him died
she had to sell everything she owned
and froze up inside
and when finally the bottom fell out
i became withdrawn
the only thing i knew how to do
was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue
so now i'm goin' back again
i got to get to her somehow
all the people we used to know
they're an illusion to me now
some are mathematicians
some are carpenter's wives
don't know how it all got started
i don't know what they're doin' with their lives
but me i'm still on the road
headin' for another joint
we always did feel the same
we just saw it from a different point of view
tangled up in blue
cd
the man in me will do nearly any task
and as for compensation there's little he would ask
take a woman like you
to get through to the man in me
storm clouds are raging all around my door
i think to myself i might not take it any more
take a woman like your kind
to find the man in me
but oh what a wonderful feeling
just to know that you are near
sets my a heart areeling
from my toes up to my ears
the man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen
but that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine
take a woman like you
to get through to the man in me
i shot the sheriff
but i didn't shoot no deputy oh no oh
i shot the sheriff
but i didn't shoot no deputy ooh ooh ooooh
all around in my home town
they're tryin' to track me down

tight pants points hardly renown
she was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
and points all her own sittin' way up high way up firm and high
out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
out in the backseat of my sixty chevy
workin on mysteries without any clues
working on our night moves
tryin' to make some front page drivein news
workin' on our night moves in the summertime hmm
in the sweet summertime
we weren't in love oh no far from it
we weren't searching for some high in the sky summit
we were just young and restless and bored living by the sword
and we'd steal away every chance we could
to the back room alley or the trusty woods
i used her she used me but neither one cared we were getting our share
working on our night moves
tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
workin' on our night moves in the summertime hmm
in the sweet summertime summertime
oh i wonder felt the lightning yeah
and waited on the thunder waited on the thunder
i woke last night to the sound of thunder

on a long and lonesome highway east of omaha
you can listen to the engine moanin' out it's one lone song
you can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
but your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
when you're riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
and you don't feel much like riding you just wish the trip was through
say here i am on the road again
there i am up on the stage
here i go playing star again
there i go turn the page ah
well you walk into a restaurant strung out from the road
and you feel the eyes upon you as you're shaking off the cold
you pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode
most times you can't hear 'em talk other times you can
all the same old clichés "is that a woman or a man"
and you always seem outnumbered you don't dare make a stand
here i am on the road again
there i am up on the stage
here i go playing star again
there i go turn the page ah
out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away
every ounce of energy you try to give away
as the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play
e||
later in the evening as you lie awake in bed
with the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head
you smoke the day's last cigarette remembering what she said
ah here i am on the road again
there i am up on the stage
here i go playing star again
there i go turn the page
ah here i am on the road again
there i am up on the stage
here i go playing star again
there i go there i go

mary's boy child jesus christ was born on christmas day
and man will live for evermore because of christmas day
long time ago in bethlehem so the holy bible say
mary's boy child jesus christ was born on christmas day
hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
and man will live for evermore because of christmas day
mary's boy child jesus christ was born on christmas day
while shepherds watch their flocks by night they see a bright new shining star
they hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar
hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
and man will live for evermore because of christmas day
for a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
there were tears of joy and laughter
people shouted "let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace"
now joseph and his wife mary came to bethlehem that night
they found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight
and then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
and in a manger cold and dark mary's little boy was born
hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
and man will live for evermore because of christmas day
mary's boy child jesus christ was born on christmas day
oh a moment still worth was a glow all the bells rang out
there were tears of joy and laughter
people shouted "let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace"
oh my lord you sent your son to save us
oh my lord your very self you gave us
oh my lord that sin may not enslave us
and love may reign once more
oh my lord when in the crib they found him
oh my lord a golden halo crowned him
oh my lord they gathered all around him
to see him and adore
oh my lord with the child's adoration
oh my lord there came great jubilation
oh my lord and full of admiration
they realized what they had

there lived a certain man in russia long ago
he was big and strong in his eyes a flaming glow
most people looked at him with terror and with fear
but to moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
he could preach the bible like a preacher
full of ecstasy and fire
but he also was the kind of teacher
women would desire
ra ra rasputin lover of the russian queen
there was a cat that really was gone
ra ra rasputin russia's greatest love machine
it was a shame how he carried on
he ruled the russian land and never mind the tsar
but the kasatschok he danced really wunderbar
in all affairs of state he was the man to please
but he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
for the queen he was no wheeler dealer
though she'd heard the things he'd done
she believed he was a holy healer
who would heal her son
ra ra rasputin lover of the russian queen
there was a cat that really was gone
ra ra rasputin russia's greatest love machine
it was a shame how he carried on
spoken underneath the above chords
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
"this man's just got to go" declared his enemies
but the ladies begged "don't you try to do it please"
no doubt this rasputin had lots of hidden charms
though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
then one night some men of high standing
set a trap they're not to blame
"come to visit us" they kept demanding
and he really came
ra ra rasputin lover of the russian queen
they put some poison into his wine
ra ra rasputin russia's greatest love machine
he drank it all and said "i feel fine"
ra ra rasputin lover of the russian queen
they didn't quit they wanted his head
ra ra rasputin russia's greatest love machine
and so they shot him till he was dead
spoken oh those russians

i am an old woman named after my mother
my old man is another child that's grown old
if dreams were thunder and lightning was desire
this old house would've burnt down a long time ago
make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
when i was a young girl i had me a cowboy
wasn't much to look at just a free ramblin' man
but that was a long time and no matter how i try
the years just flow by like a brokendown dam
make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
there's flies in the kitchen i can hear them abuzzin'
but i ain't done nothin' since i woke up today
how the hell can a person go to work in the morning
come home in the evenin' they got nothin' to say
make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
it's a heartache nothing but a heartache
hits you when it's too late hits you when you're down
it's a fool's game nothing but a fool's game
standing in the cold rain feeling like a clown
it's a heartache nothing but a heartache
love him till your arms break then he let's you down
it ain't right with love to share
when you find he doesn't care for you
it ain't wise to need someone
as much as i depended on you
it's a heartache nothing but a heartache
hits you when it's too late hits you when you're down
it's a fool's game nothing but a fool's game
standing in the cold rain feeling like a clown
it's a heartache nothing but a heartache
love him till your arms break then he let's you down
it ain't right with love to share
when you find he doesn't care for you
it ain't wise to need someone
as much as i depended on you
it's a heartache nothing but a heartache
love him till your arms break then he lets you down
it's a fool's game
standing in the cold rain feeling like a clown
it's a heartache
love him till your arms break then he lets you down
it's a heartache

slipped away

e||
it's more than a feeling more than a feeling
when i hear that old song they used to play
and i begin dreaming more than a feeling
'til i see marianne walk away
i see my marianne walking away

yet i still recall as i wonder on as clear as the sun
in the summer sky

e||
it's more than a feeling more than a feeling
when i hear that old song they used to play
and i begin dreaming more than a feeling
'til i see marianne walk away
i see my marianne walking away
e||
e||
e|| e||


i closed my eyes and she slipped away
she slipped away

e||
it's more than a feeling more than a feeling
when i hear that old song they used to play
and i begin dreaming more than a feeling
'til i see marianne walk away
not entirely sure of the last g possibly em
you sheltered me from harm
kept me warm kept me warm
you gave my life to me
set me free set me free
the finest years i ever knew
were all the years i had with you
and i would give anything i own
give up my life my heart my home
i would give everything i own
just to have you back again
you taught me how to love
what it s of what it s of
you never said too much
but still you showed the way
and i knew i m watching you
nobody else could ever know
the part of me that can't let go
and i would give anything i own
give up my life my heart my home
i would give everything i own
just to have you back again
is there someone you know
you're loving them so
but taking them all for granted
you may lose them one day
someone takes them away
and they don't hear the words you long to say
and i would give anything i own
give up my life my heart my home
i would give everything i own
just to have you back again
just to touch you once again
if a picture paints a thousand words then why can't i paint you
the words will never show the you i've come to know
if a face could launch a thousand ships then where am i to go
there's no one home but you you're all that's left me to
and when my love for life is running dry
you come and pour yourself on me
if a man could be two places at one time i'd be with you
tomorrow and today beside you all the way
if the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die
i'd spend the end with you and when the world was through
then one by one the stars would all go out
then you and i would simply fly away
hey have you ever tried
really reaching out for the other side
i may be climbing on rainbows
dreams they re for those who sleep
life is for us to keep
and if you're wondering
what this song is leading to
i want to make it with you
i really think
that we could make it girl
no you don't know me well
in every little thing only time will tell
if you believe the things that i do
and we'll see it through
life can be short or long
love can be right or wrong
and if i chose the one
i'd like to help me through
i'd like to make it with you
i really think
that we could make it girl
baby you know that dreams
they're for those who sleep
life it's for us to keep
and if i chose the one
i'd like to help me through
i'd like to make it with you
i really think
that we could make it girl
in the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway american dream
at night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
sprung from cages on highway chromewheeled fuelinjected
and steppin' out over the line whoah
baby this town rips the bones from your back
it's a death trap it's a suicide rap we gotta get out while we're young
'cause tramps like us baby we were born to run
wendy let me in i wanna be your friend i want to guard your dreams and visions
just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims and strap your hands across my engines
together we could break this trap we'll run till we drop baby we'll never go back whoah
will you walk with me out on the wire 'cause baby i'm just a scared and lonely rider
but i gotta find out how it feels
i want to know if love is wild babe i want to know if love is real
beyond the palace hemipowered drones scream down the boulevard
girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors and the boys try to look so hard
the amusement park rises bold and stark kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
i wanna die with you wendy on the streets tonight in an ever lasting kiss
e||
the highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide
together wendy we can live with the sadness
i'll love you with all the madness in my soul whoah
someday girl i don't know when we're gonna get to that place
where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
but till then tramps like us baby we were born to run
ah honey tramps like us baby we were born to run
come on wendy tramps like us baby we were born to run
whoah oh oh oh etc
ohhhh
you walked into the party
like you were walking on to a yacht
your hat strategically dipped below one eye
your scarf it was apricot
you had one eye in the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte
and all the girls dreamed that they’d be your partner they'd be your partner and
you're so vain
you prob'ly think this song is about you
you're so vain
i’ll bet you think this song is about you don't you don't you
you had me several years ago
when i was still quite naive
well you said that we make such a pretty pair
and that you would never leave
but you gave away the things you loved and one of them was me
i had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee clouds in my coffee and
you're so vain
you prob'ly think this song is about you
you're so vain
i’ll bet you think this song is about you don't you don't you don't you
i had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee clouds in my coffee and
you're so vain
you prob'ly think this song is about you
you're so vain
i’ll bet you think this song is about you don't you don't you
well i hear you went up to saratoga and your horse naturally won
then you flew your lear jet up to nova scotia
to see the total eclipse of the sun
well you're where you should be all the time
and when you're not you're with
some under world spy or the wife of a close friend wife of a close friend and
you're so vain
you prob'ly think this song is about you
you're so vain
i’ll bet you think this song is about you don't you don't you don't you now
you're so vain you prob'ly think this song is about you
you're so vain you prob'ly think this song is about you
stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
there's something wrong here there can be no denying
one of us is changing or maybe we just stopped trying
and it's too late baby now it's too late
though we really did try to make it
something inside has died and i can't hide
and i just can't fake it
it used to be so easy living here with you
you were light and breezy and i knew just what to do
now you look so unhappy and i feel like a fool
and it's too late baby now it's too late
though we really did try to make it
something inside has died and i can't hide
and i just can't fake it no no
there'll be good times again for me and you
but we just can't stay together don't you feel it too
still i'm glad for what we had and how i once loved you
and it's too late baby now it's too late
though we really did try to make it
something inside has died and i can't hide
and i just can't fake it no no
it`s too late darling it’s too late baby it’s too late

so far a way
doesn't anybody stay in one place any more
it would be so fine to see your face at my door
it doesn't help to know you're just time a way
long ago i reached for you and there you stood
holding you a gain could only do me good
how i wish i could but you're so
far a way | |
one more song about moving along the highway
can't say much of anything that's new
if i could only work this life out my way
i'd rather spend it being close to you
but you're so far a way
doesn't anybody stay in one place any more
it would be so fine to see your face at my door
it doesn't help to know you're so far a way
yeah eah you're so far a way | |
traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
nothing else to do but close my mind
i sure hope the road don't come to own me
there's so many dreams i've yet to find
but you're so far a way
doesn't anybody stay in one place any more
it would be so fine to see your face at my door
and it doesn't help to know you're so far a way
yeah eah you're so far a way
hey you're so far a way

tonight the light of love is in your eyes
but will you love me tomorrow

or just a moment's pleasure

meets the morning sun

is love i can be sure of so

i fell in love with you
before the second show
your guitar it sounds so sweet and clear
but you're not really here
it's just the radio
don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
said you'd be coming back this way again baby
baby baby baby baby oh baby
i love you i really do
loneliness is a such a sad affair
and i can hardly wait to be with you again
what to say to make you come again
come back to me again
and play your sad guitar

said you'd be coming back this way again baby
baby baby baby baby oh baby

don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
said you'd be coming back this way again baby
baby baby baby baby oh baby
i love you i really do
such a feeling's coming over me there is wonder in most every thing i see
not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes
and i won't be surprised if it's a dream
everything i want the world to be is now coming true especial ly for me
and the reason is clear it's because you are here
you're the nearest thing to heaven that i've seen
i'm on top of the world looking down on creation
and the only expla nation i can find
is the love that i've found ever since you've been a round
your love's put me at the top of the world
something in the wind has learned my name
and it's telling me that things are not the same
in the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
there's a pleasing sense of happiness for me
there is only one wish on my mind
when this day is through i hope that i will find
that to morrow will be just the same for you and me
all i need will be mine if you are here
i'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
and the only expla nation i can find
is the love that i've found ever since you've been a round
your love's put me at the top of the world
i'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
and the only expla nation i can find
is the love that i've found ever since you've been a round
your love's put me at the top of the world
when i was young
i'd listened to the radio
waitin' for my favorite songs
when they played i'd sing along
it made me smile
those were such happy times
and not so long ago
how i wondered where they'd gone
but they're back again
just like a long lost friend
all the songs i loved so well
every shalalala
every wowowo
still shines
every shingalingaling
that they're starting to sing
so fine
when they get to the part
where he's breakin' her heart
it can really make me cry
just like before
it's yesterday once more
lookin' back on how it was
in years gone by
and the good times that i had
makes today seem rather sad
so much has changed
it was songs of love that
i would sing to then
and i'd memorize each word
those old melodies
still sound so good to me
as they melt the years away
every shalalala
every wowowo
still shines
every shingalingaling
that they're starting to sing
so fine
all my best memories
come back clearly to me
some can even make me cry
just like before
it's yesterday once more
every shalalala
every wowowo
still shines
every shingalingaling
that they're starting to sing
so fine
every shalalala
every wowowo
still shines
every shingalingaling
that they're starting to sing
so fine

it's not time to make a change just relax and take it easy
you're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to know
find a girl settle down if you want to you can marry
look at me i am old but i'm happy
i was once like you are now and i know that it's not easy
to be calm when you've found something going on
but take your time think a lot why think of everything you've got
for you will still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not
e||
how can i try to explain 'cause when i do he turns away again
it's always been the same same old story
from the moment i could talk i was ordered to listen
now there's a way and i know that i have to go away
i know i have to go
e||
it's not time to make a change just sit down and take it slowly
you're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to go through
find a girl settle down if you want you can marry
look at me i am old but i'm happy
all the times that i've cried keeping all the things i knew inside
it's hard but it's harder to ignore it
if they were right i'd agree but it's them they know not me
now there's a way and i know that i have to go away
i know i have to go
morning has broken like the first morning
blackbird has spoken like the first bird
praise for the singing praise for the morning
praise for them springing fresh from the word
sweet the rain's new fall sunlit from heaven
like the first dew fall on the first grass
praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
sprung in completeness where his feet pass
mine is the sunlight mine is the morning
born of the one light eden saw play
praise with elation praise every morning
god's recreation of the new day
morning has broken like the first morning
blackbird has spoken like the first bird
praise for the singing praise for the morning
praise for them springing fresh from the word

a spaceman came travelling on his ship from afar
'twas light years of time since his mission did start
and over a village he halted his craft
and it hung in the sky like a star just like a star
he followed a light and came down to a shed
where a mother and child were lying there on a bed
a bright light of silver shone round his head
and he had the face of an angel and they were afraid
then the stranger spoke he said "do not fear
i come from a planet a long way from here
and i bring a message for mankind to hear"
and suddenly the sweetest music filled the air
and it went la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la
peace and goodwill to all of men and love for the child
la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la
oh oh oh
this lovely music went trembling through the ground
and many were wakened on hearing that sound
and travellers on the road the village they found
by the light of that ship in the sky which shone all around
and just before dawn at the paling of the sky
the stranger returned and said "now i must fly
when two thousand years of your time has gone by
this song will begin once again to a babys cry"
and it went la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la
peace and goodwill to all of men and love for the child
and i hear la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la
this song will begin once again to a babys cry"
and it went la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la
this song will begin once again to a babys cry"

just got home from illinois lock the front door oh boy
got to sit down take a rest on the porch
imagination sets in pretty soon i'm singing
doo doo doo lookin' out my back door
there's a giant doing cartwheels a statue wearin' high heels
look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
a dinosaur victrola listening to buck owens
doo doo doo lookin' out my back door
tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon
wond'rous apparition provided by magician
doo doo doo lookin' out my back door
tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon
bother me tomorrow today i'll buy no sorrows
doo doo doo lookin' out my back door
forward troubles illinois lock the front door oh boy
look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
bother me tomorrow today i'll buy no sorrows
doo doo doo lookin' out my back door

long as i remember the rain been comin' down
clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground
good men through the ages
tryin' to find the sun
and i wonder still i wonder
who'll stop the rain
i went down virginia seeking shelter from the storm
caught up in the fable i watched the tower grow
fiveyear plans and new deals
wrapped in golden chains
and i wonder still i wonder
who'll stop the rain
heard the singers playin' how we cheered for more
the crowd had rushed together tryin' to keep warm
still the rain kept pourin'
fallin' on my ears
and i wonder still i wonder
who'll stop the rain

there is a town in north ontario
with dream comfort memory to spare
and in my mind i still need a place to go
all my changes were there
blue blue windows behind the stars
yellow moon on the rise
big birds flying across the sky
throwing shadows on our eyes
helpless helpless helpless
baby can you hear me now
the chains are locked and tied across the door
baby sing with me some how
blue blue windows behind the stars
yellow moon on the rise
big birds flying across the sky
throwing shadows on our eyes
helpless helpless helpless
i'll light the fire
you place the flowers in the vase
that you bought today
staring at the fire
for hours and hours
while i listen to you play your love songs
all night long for me
only for me
come to me now
and rest your head for just five minutes
everything is done
such a cozy room
the windows are illuminated
by the evening sunshine through them
fiery gems for you
only for you
our house is a very very very fine house
with two cats in the yard
life used to be so hard
now everything is easy 'cause of you and i
la la la
our house is a very very very fine house
with two cats in the yard
life used to be so hard
now everything is easy 'cause of you
i'll light the fire
while you place the flowers in the vase
that you bought today
you who are on the road
must have a code that you can live by
and so become yourself
because the past is just a goodbye
teach your children well
their father's hell did slowly go by
and feed them on your dreams
the one they picked's the one you'll know by
don't you ever ask them why if they told you you will cry
so just look at them and sigh
and know they love you
and you of tender years
can't know the fears that your elders grew by
and so please help them with your youth
they seek the truth before they can die
teach your parents well
their children's hell will slowly go by
and feed them on your dreams
the one they picked's the one you'll know by
don't you ever ask them why if they told you you will cry
so just look at them and sigh
and know they love you
you ask me if i love you and i choke on my reply
i'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie
and who i am to judge you on what you say or do
i'm only just beginning to see the real you
and sometimes when we touch the honesty's too much
and i have to close my eyes and hide
i wanna hold you til i die til we both break down and cry
i wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
romance and all its strategy leaves me battling with my pride
but through the insecurity some tenderness survives
i'm just another writer still trapped within my truth
a hesitant prize fighter still trapped within my youth
and sometimes when we touch the honesty's too much
and i have to close my eyes and hide
i wanna hold you til i die til we both break down and cry
i wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
at times i'd like to break you and drive you to your knees
at times i'd like to break through and hold you endlessly
at times i understand you and i know how hard you've tried
i've watched while love commands you and i've watched love pass you by
at times i think we're drifters still searching for a friend
a brother or a sister but then the passion flares again
and sometimes when we touch the honesty's too much
and i have to close my eyes and hide
i wanna hold you til i die til we both break down and cry
i wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
oh yeah
still don't know what i was waiting for
and my time was running wild
a million deadend streets and
every time i thought i'd got it made
it seemed the taste was not so sweet
so i turned myself to face me
but i've never caught a glimpse
of how the others must see the faker
i'm much too fast to take that test
chchchchchanges
turn and face the strange
chchchanges
don't want to be a richer man
chchchchchanges
turn and face the strange
chchchanges
it's gonna have to be a different man
time may change me
but i can't trace time
i watch the ripples change their size
but never leave the stream of warm impermanence
and so the days float through my eyes
but still the days seem the same
and these children that you spit on
as they try to change their worlds
are immune to your consultations
they're quite aware of what they're going through
chchchchchanges
turn and face the strange
chchchanges
don't want to be a richer man
chchchchchanges
turn and face the strange
chchchanges
it's gonna have to be a different man
time may change me
but you can't trace time
strange fascination fascinating me
changes are taking the pace i'm going through
chchchchchanges
turn and face the strange
chchchanges
look out you rock'n'rollers
chchchchchanges
turn and face the strange
chchchanges
pretty soon now you're gonna get older
time may change me
but i can't trace time
i said that time may change me
but i can't trace time
pushing through the market square so many mothers sighing
news had just come over we had five years left to cry in
news guy wept and told us earth was really dying
cried so much his face was wet then i knew he was not lying
i heard telephones opera house favorite melodies
i saw boys toys electric irons and tv's
my brain hurt like a warehouse it had no room to spare
i had to cram so many things to store everything in there
and all the fatskinny people
and all the tallshort people
and all the nobody people
and all the somebody people
i never thought i'd need so many people
a girl my age went off her head hit some tiny children
if the black hadn't apulled her off i think she would have killed them
a soldier with a broken arm fixed his stare to the wheels of a cadillac
a cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priestand a queer threw up at the sight of that
i think i saw you in an icecream parlor drinking milk shakes cold and long
smiling and waving and looking so fine don't think you knew you were in this song
and it was cold and it rained so i felt like an actor
and i thought of ma and i wanted to get back there
your face your race the way that you talk
i kiss you you're beautiful i want you to walk
we've got five years stuck on my eyes
five years what a surprise
we've got five years my brain hurts a lot

i i wish you could swim
like the dolphins like dolphins can swim
though nothing nothing will keep us together
we can beat them forever and ever
oh we can be heroes just for one day
i i will be king
and you you will be queen
for nothing will drive them away
we can be heroes just for one day
we can be honest just for one day
i i can remember i remember
standing by the wall by the wall
and the guards shot above our heads over our heads
and we kissed as though nothing would fall nothing could fall
and the shame was on the other side
oh we can beat them forever and ever
then we can be heroes just for one day
we can be heroes
we can be heroes
we can be heroes just for one day
we can be heroes
it's a godawful small affair to the girl with the mousy hair
but her mummy is yelling "no" and her daddy has told her to go
but her friend is nowhere to be seen
now she walks through her sunken dream
to the seat with the clearest view
and she's hooked to the silver screen
but the film is a saddening bore
for she's lived it ten times or more
she could spit in the eyes of fools as they ask her to focus on
sailors fighting in the dance hall
oh man look at those cavemen go it's a freakest show
take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy
oh man wonder if he'll ever know he's in the best selling show
is there life on mars
it's on amerika's tortured brow
mickey mouse has grown up a cow
now the workers have struck for fame
cause lennon's on sale again
see the mice in their million hordes
from ibeza to the norfolk broads
rule brittania is out of bounds
to my mother my dog and clowns
but the film is a saddening bore
`cause i wrote it ten times before
it's about to be writ again
as i ask you to focus on
sailors fighting in the dance hall
oh man look at those cavemen go it's a freakest show
take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy
oh man wonder if he'll ever know he's in the best selling show
is there life on mars

time takes a cigarette puts it in your mouth
you pull on your finger then another finger then your cigarette
the wall to wall is calling it lingers then you forget
ohohohoh you're a rock'n roll suicide
you're too old to lose it too young to choose it
and the clock waits so patiently on your song
you walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
oh no no no you're a rock'n roll suicide
chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
but the day breaks instead so you hurry home
don't let the sun blast your shadow
don't let the milk float ride your mind
they're so natural religiously unkind
oh no love you're not alone
you're watching yourself but you're too unfair
you got your head all tangled up but if i could only make you care
oh no love you're not alone

didn't know what time it was the lights were lowowow
i lean back on my radiooo
some cat was laying down some rock'n'roll
'lotta soul' he said
then the loud sound did seem to faaade
came back like a slow voice on a wave of phaaase
that weren't no dj that was hazy cosmic jive
there's a starman waiting in the sky
he'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'd blow our minds
there's a starman waiting in the sky
he's told us not to blow it
'cause he knows it's all worthwhile
"let the children lose it let the children use it
let all the children boogie"
well i had to phone someone so i picked on yououou
hey that's far out so you heard him toooooo
switch on the tv we may pick him up on channel
look out your window i can see his liiight
if we can sparkle he may land toniiight

there's a starman waiting in the sky
he'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'd blow our minds
there's a starman waiting in the sky

'cause he knows it's all worthwhile

we passed upon the stair
we spoke of was and when
although i wasn't there
he said i was his friend
which came as some surprise
i spoke into his eyes
i thought you died alone
a long long time ago
oh no not me
i never lost control
you're face to face
with the man who sold the world
i laughed and shook his hand
and made my way back home
i searched for form and land
for years and years i roamed
i gazed a gazely stare
at all the millions here
we must have died alone
a long long time ago
who knows not me
we never lost control
you're face to face
with the man who sold the world
who knows not me
we never lost control
you're face to face
with the man who sold the world
fade out
now ziggy played guitar
jamming good with weird and gilly
and the spiders from mars
he played it left hand
but made it too far
became the special man
then we were ziggy's band
ziggy really sang
screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
like some cat from japan
he could lick 'em by smiling
he could leave them to hang
they came on so loaded man
well hung snow white tan
so where were the spiders
while the fly tried to break our balls
just the beer light to guide us
so we bitched about his fans
and should we crush his sweet hands
ziggy played for time
jiving us that we were voodoo
the kids were just crass
he was the nazz
with god given ass
he took it all too far
but boy could he play guitar
making love with his ego
ziggy sucked up into his mind
like a leper messiah
when the kids had killed the man
i had to break up the band
yeah ooo
ziggy played guitar
we all came out to montreux
on the lake geneva shoreline
to make records with a mobile
we didn't have much time
frank zappa and the mothers
were at the best place around
but some stupid with a flare gun
burned the place to the ground
smoke on the water fire in the sky
smoke on the water
they burned down the gambling house
it died with an awful sound
funky claude was running in and out
pulling kids out the ground
when it all was over
we had to find another place
but swiss time was running out
it seemed that we would lose the race
smoke on the water fire in the sky
smoke on the water
we ended up at the grand hotel
it was empty cold and bare
but with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
making our music there
with a few red lights and a few old beds
we make a place to sweat
no matter what we get out of this
i know i know we'll never forget
smoke on the water fire in the sky
smoke on the water
i have often told you stories
about the way
i lived the life of a drifter
waiting for the day
when i'd take your hand and sing you songs
then maybe you would say
come lay with me and love me
and i would surely stay
but i feel i'm growing older
and the songs that i have sung
echo in the distance
like the sound
of a windmill going round
guess i'll always be
a soldier of fortune
many times i've been a traveller
i looked for something new
in days of old when nights were cold
i wandered without you
but those days i thought my eyes
had seen you standing near
though blindness is confusing
it shows that you're not here
but i feel i'm growing older
and the songs that i have sung
echo in the distance
like the sound
of a windmill going round
guess i'll always be
a soldier of fortune
yes i can hear the sound
of a windmill going round
i guess i'll always be
a soldier of fortune
i guess i'll always be
a soldier of fortune
you get a shiver in the dark it's raining in the park but meantime
south of the river you stop and you hold everything
a band is blowing dixie double four time
you feel alright when you hear that music ring
well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
competition in other places
uh but the horns they blowin' that sound
way on down south
way on down south
london town
you check out guitar george he knows all the chords
mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
they say an old guitar is all he can afford
when he gets up under the lights to play his thing
and harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
he's got a daytime job he's doin' alright
he can play the honky tonk like anything
saving it up for friday night
with the sultans
with the sultans of swing
then a crowd of young boys they're foolin' around in the corner
drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
they don't give a damn about about any trumpet playin' band
it ain't what they call rock and roll
and the sultans
yeah the sultans they play creole
creole
and then the man he steps right up to the microphone
and says at last just as the time bell ring
goodnight now it's time to go home
then he makes it fast with one more thing
we are the sultans
we are the sultans of swing
repeat and fade approx
day after day i'm more confused
i look for the light in the pouring rain
you know it's a game i hate to lose
now i'm feelin' the strain ain't it a shame
oh give me the beat boys to free my soul
i wanna get lost in your rocknroll and
drift away
oh give me the beat boys to free my soul
i wanna get lost in your rocknroll and
drift away
i'm beginning to think i'm was wastin' time
i don't understand the things i do
the world outside looks so unkind
i'm counting on you to carry me through
oh give me the beat boys to free my soul
i wanna get lost in your rocknroll and
drift away
yeah give me the beat boys to free my soul
i wanna get lost in your rocknroll and
drift away
and when my mind is free
you know melody can move me
and when i'm feeling blue
the guitars are coming through to
soothe me
thanks for the joy that you've given me
i want you to know i believe in your song
the rhythm the rhyme and the harmony
you help me along making me strong
oh give me the beat boys to free my soul
i wanna get lost in your rocknroll and
drift away
oh give me the beat boys to free my soul
i wanna get lost in your rocknroll and
drift away
back through the years
back to the seasons of my youth
i recall a box of rags that someone gave us
and how my momma put the rags to use
there were rags of many colors
every piece was small
and it was way down in the fall
momma sewed the rags together
sewin every piece with love
she made my coat of many colors
that i was so proud of
as she sewed she told a story
from the bible she had read
joseph wore and then she said
perhaps this coat will bring you
good luck and happiness
and i just couldn't wait to wear it
and momma blessed it with a kiss
my coat of many colors
that my momma made for me
made only from rags
but i wore it so proudly
although we had no money
well i was rich as i could be
in my coat of many colors
my momma made for me
so with patches on my britches
and holes in both my shoes
i hurried off to school
just to find the others laughing
and making fun of me
in my coat of many colors
my momma made for me
and oh i couldn't understand it
for i felt i was rich
my momma sewed in every stitch
and i told em all the story
momma told me while she sewed
and how my coat of many colors
was worth more than all their clothes
but they didn't understand it
and i tried to make them see
that one is only poor
only if they choose to be
now i know we had no money
but i was rich as i could be
in my coat of many colors
my momma made for me
made just for me
if i should stay
i would only be in your way
so i'll go but i know
i'll think of you each step of the way
and iwill always love you
will always love you
bittersweet memories
that's all i am taking with me
goodbye please don't cry
we both know that i'm not what you need
but iwill always love you
will always love you
i hope life treats you kind
and i hope that you have all that you ever dreamed of
and i wish you joy and happiness
but above all of this i wish you love
and iwill always love you
will always love you
i will always love you

jolene jolene jolene jolene
i'm begging of you please don't take my man
jolene jolene jolene jolene
please don't take him just because you can
your beauty is beyond compare
with flaming locks of auburn hair
with ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
your smile is like a breath of spring
your voice is soft like summer rain
and i cannot compete with you jolene
he talks about you in his sleep
there's nothing i can do to keep
from crying when he calls your name jolene
and i can easily understand
how you could easily take my man
but you don't know what he means to me jolene
jolene jolene jolene jolene
i'm begging of you please don't take my man
jolene jolene jolene jolene
please don't take him just because you can
you could have your choice of men
but i could never love again

i had to have this talk with you
my happiness depends on you
and whatever you decide to do jolene
jolene jolene jolene jolene
i'm begging of you please don't take my man
jolene jolene jolene jolene

a long long time ago
i can still remember how that music used to make me smile
and i knew if i had my chance
that i could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while
but february made me shiver with every paper i'd deliver
bad news on the doorstep i couldn't take one more step
i can't remember if i cried when i read about his widowed bride
something touched me deep inside
the day the music died
so bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin' this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die
did you write the book of love
and do you have faith in god above if the bible tells you so
do you believe in rock and roll
can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow
well i know that you're in love with him 'cuz i saw you dancin' in the gym
you both kicked off your shoes man i dig those rhythm and blues
i was a lonely teenage bronckin' buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
but i knew i was out of luck the day the music died i started singin'
bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin' this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die
now for ten years we've been on our own
and moss grows fat on a rolling stone but that's not how it used to be
when the jester sang for the king and queen
in a coat he borrowed from james dean in a voice that came from you and me
oh and while the king was looking down the jester stole his thorny crown
the courtroom was adjourned no verdict was returned
and while lennin read a book on marx the quartet practiced in the park
and we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died we were singin'
bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin' this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die
helter skelter in a summer swelter
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter eight miles high and fallin' fast
it landed foul on the grass
the players tried for a forward pass with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
now the halftime air was sweet perfume while sergeants played a marching tune
we all got up to dance but we never got the chance
'cuz the players tried to take the field the marching band refused to yield
do you recall what was revealed the day the music died we started singin'
bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin' this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die
and there we were all in one place
a generation lost in space with no time left to start again
so come on jack be nimble jack be quick jack flash sat on a candle
stick 'cuz fire is the devil's only friend
and as i watched him on the stage my hands were clenched in fists of rage
no angel born in hell could break that satan's spell
and as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite
i saw satan laughing with delight the day the music died he was singin'
bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin' this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die
i met a girl who sang the blues
and i asked her for some happy news but she just smiled and turned away
i went down to the sacred store
where i'd heard the music years before but the man there said the music
wouldn't play
but in the streets the children screamed the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
but not a word was spoken the church bells all were broken
and the three men i admire most the father son and the holy ghost
they caught the last train for the coast the day the music died
bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin' this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die
they were singin' bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin' this will be the day that i die
starry starry night
paint your pallet blue and grey
look out on a summer's day with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
shadows on the hills sketch the trees and the daffodils
catch the breeze and the winter chills in colours on the snowy linen land
and now i understand what you tried to say to me
how you suffered for your sanity how you tried to set them free
they would not listen they did not know how perhaps they listen now
starry starry night
flaming flowers that brightly blaze
swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue
colors changing hue morning fields of amber grain
weathered faces lined in pain are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
and now i understand what you tried to say to me
how you suffered for your sanity how you tried to set them free
they would not listen they did not know how perhaps they listen now
for they could not love you but still your love was true
and when no hope was left in sight on that starry starry night
you took your life as lovers often do but i could have told you vincent
this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you
starry starry night
portraits hung in empty halls
frameless heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
like the strangers that you've met the ragged men in ragged clothes
the silver thorn the bloody rose lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
and now i think i know what you tried to say to me
how you suffered for your sanity how you tried to set them free
they would not listen they're not listening still perhaps they never will
i don't know if you can see
the changes that have come over me
in these last few days i've been afraid
that i might drift away
i've been telling stories singing songs
that make me think about where i come from
that's the reason why i seem
so far away today
let me tell you that i love you
that i think about you all the time
caledonia you're calling me
now i'm going home
but if i should become a stranger
know that it would make me more than sad
caledonia's been everything i've ever had
now i have moved and kept on moving
proved the points that i needed proving
lost the friends that i needed losing
found others on the way
i have kissed the ladies and left them crying
stolen dreams yes there's no denying
i have travelled hard sometimes with conscience flying
somewhere with the wind
let me tell you that i love you
that i think about you all the time
caledonia you're calling me
now i'm going home
but if i should become a stranger
know that it would make me more than sad
caledonia's been everything i've ever had
now i'm sitting here before the fire
the empty room a forest choir
the flames that couldn't get any higher
they've withered now they've gone
but i'm steady thinking my way is clear
and i know what i will do tomorrow
when hands have shaken and kisses flown
then i will disappear
let me tell you that i love you
that i think about you all the time
caledonia you're calling me
now i'm going home
but if i should become a stranger
know that it would make me more than sad
caledonia's been everything i've ever had
every night i'm lying in bed holding you close in my dreams
thinking about all the things that we said and coming apart at the seams
we try to talk it over but the words come out too rough
i know you were trying to give me the best of your love
beautiful faces and loud empty places look at the way that we live
wasting our time on cheap talk and wine left us so little to give
that same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud that we could never rise above
but here in my heart i give you the best of my love
ohohoh ohhhh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love
ohohoh ohhhh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love
i'm going back in time and it's a sweet dream
it was a quiet night and i would be all right if i could go on sleeping
but every morning i wake up and worry what's gonna happen today
you see it your way and i see it mine but we both see it slipping away
you know we always had each other baby i guess that wasn't enough ooohh
but here in my heart i give you the best of my love
ohohoh ohhhh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love
ohohoh ohhhh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love

desperado why don't you come to your senses
you been out ridin' fences for so long now
oh you're a hard one i know that you got your reasons
these things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow
don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
she'll beat you if she's able
you know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
but you only want the ones you can't get
desperado oh you ain't gettin' no younger
your pain and your hunger they're drivin' you home
and freedom well that's just some people talkin'
your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
don't your feet get cold in the winter time
the sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
it's hard to tell the night time from the day
you're losin' all your highs and lows
ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away
desperado why don't you come to your senses
come down from your fences open the gate
it may be rainin' but there's a rainbow above you
you better let somebody love you
you better let somebody love you before it's too late
on a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair
warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
up ahead in the distance i saw a shimmering light
my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
i had to stop for the night
there she stood in the doorway i heard the mission bell
and i was thinking to myself
this could be heaven or this could be hell
then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
there were voices down the corridor
i thought i heard them say
welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place such a lovely place such a lovely face
plenty of room at the hotel california
any time of year any time of year you can find it here
her mind is tiffanytwisted she got the mercedes bends
she got a lot of pretty pretty boys she calls friends
how they danced in the courtyard sweet summer sweat
some dance to remember some dance to forget
so i called up the captain please bring me my wine he said
we haven't had that spirit here since
and still those voices are calling from far away
wake you up in the middle of the night
just to hear them say
welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place such a lovely place such a lovely face
they're livin' it up at the hotel california
what a nice surprise what a nice surprise bring your alibis
mirrors on the ceiling the pink champagne on ice and she said
we are all just prisoners here of our own device
and in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast
they stab it with their steely knives but they
just can't kill the beast
last thing i remember i was running for the door
i had to find the passage back to the place i was before
"relax" said the night man we are programmed to receive
you can check out any time you like
but you can never leave
city girls just seem to find out early
how to open doors with just a smile
a rich old man and she won't have to worry
she'll dress up all in lace and go in style
late at night a big old house gets lonely
i guess every form of refuge has its price
and it breaks her heart to think her love is only
given to a man with hands as cold as ice
so she tells him she must go out for the evening
to comfort an old friend who's feeling down
but he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
she's headed for the cheatin' side of town
you can't hi ide your lyin' eyes and your smi ile is a thin disguise
i thought by no ow you'd reali ize there ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
on the other side of town a boy is waiting
with fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
she drives on through the night anticipating
cos he makes her feel the way she used to feel
she rushes to his arms they fall together
she whispers that it's only for a while
she swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
she pulls away and leaves him with a smile
you can't hi ide your lyin' eyes and your smiiile is a thin disguise
i thought by no ow you'd reali ize there ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
she gets up and pours herself a strong one
and stares out at the stars up in the sky
another night it's gonna be a long one
she draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
she wonders how it ever got this crazy
she thinks about a boy she knew in school
did she get tired or did she just get lazy
she's so far gone she feels just like a fool
my oh my you sure know how to arrange things
you set it up so well so carefully
ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
you're still the same old girl you used to be
you can't hi ide your lyin' eyes and your smii ile is a thin disguise
i thought by no ow you'd reali ize there ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
there ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
honey you can't hide your lyin' eyes

all alone at the end of the evening
and the bright lights have faded to blue
i was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me
but i never knew
you know i've always been a dreamer spend my life runnin' round
and it's so hard to change can't seem to settle down
but the dreams i've seen lately keep on turnin' out
and burnin' out and turnin' out the sa me
so put me on a highway and show me a sign
and take it to the limit one more time
you can spend all your time making money
or you can spend all your love making time
if it all fell to pieces tomorrow
would you still be mine
and when you're looking for your freedom nobody seems to care
and you can't find the door can't find it anywhere
when there's nothing to believe in still you're coming back
you're running back you're coming back for mo re
so put me on a highway and show me a sign
and take it to the limit one more time
take it to the limit take it to the limit
take it to the limit one more time |
it's another tequila sunrise
starin' slowly 'cross the sky
said goodbye
he was just a hired hand
workin' on the dreams he planned to try
the days go by
every night when the sun goes down
just another lonely boy in town
and she's out runnin' round
she wasn't just another woman
and i couldn't keep from comin' on
it's been so long
oh and it's a hollow feelin'
when it comes down to dealin' friends
it never ends
take another shot of courage
wonder why the right words never co ome
you just get numb
it's another tequila sunrise
this old world still looks the same
another frame

goodbye norma jean
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
they crawled out of the woodwork
and they whispered into your brain
they set you on the treadmill
and they made you change your name
and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would have liked to have known you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
loneliness was tough
the toughest role you ever played
hollywood created a superstar
and pain was the price you paid
even when you died
oh the press still hounded you
was that marilyn was found in the nude
and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would have liked to have known you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
goodbye norma jean
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
goodbye norma jean
from the young man in the row
who sees you as something more than sexual
more than just our marilyn monroe
and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would have liked to have known you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
i remember when rock was young me and susie had so much fun
holding hands and skimmin' stones had a old gold chevy a place of my own
but the biggest kick i ever got was doin' a thing called the crocodile rock
while the other kids were rockin' 'round the clock we were hoppin' and
crocodile rockin' is something shockin' when your feet just can't keep still
i never knew me a better time and i guess i never will
oh lawdy mamma those friday nights when susie wore her dresses tight and
the crocodile rockin' was out of sight
but the years went by and rock just died susie went and left me for some foreign guy
long nights cryin' by the record machine dreamin' of my chevy my old blue jeans but they'll
never kill the thrills we got burnin' up to the crocodile rock
learning fast as the weeks went past we really thought the crocodile rock would last well
crocodile rockin' is something shockin' when your feet just can't keep still
i never knew me a better time and i guess i never will
oh lawdy mamma those friday nights when susie wore her dresses tight and
the crocodile rockin' was out of sight
i remember when rock was young me and susie had so much fun

the crocodile rockin' was out of sight

it's too late to save myself from falling
i took a chance and changed your way of life
but you misread my meaning when i met you
closed the door and left me blind by the light ohhh
don't let the sun go down on me
although i search myself it's always someone else i see
i'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free yea
but losing everything is like the sun going down on me
i can't find oh the right romantic line
but see me once and see the way i feel
don't discard me just because you think i mean you harm
but these cuts i have oh they need love to help them heal oh
don't let the sun go down on me
although i search myself it's always someone else i see
i'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free yea
but losing everything is like the sun going down on me
when are you gonna come down
when are you going to land
i should have stayed on the farm i should have
listened to my old man
you know you can't hold me forever
i didn't sign up with you
i'm not a present for your friends to open
this boy's too young to be singing the
blues ahahahah ahahah
so goodbye yellow brick road
where the dogs of society howl
you can't plant me in your penthouse
i'm going back to my plough
back to the howling old owl in the woods
hunting the horny back toad
oh i've finally decided my future lies
beyond the yellow brick
road ahahahah ahahah ah
what do you think you'll do then
i bet they'll shoot down your plane
it'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
to set you on your feet again
maybe you'll get a replacement
there's plenty like me to be found
mongrels who ain't got a penny
sniffing for titbits like you on the
ground ahahahah ahahah
so goodbye yellow brick road
where the dogs of society howl
you can't plant me in your penthouse
i'm going back to my plough
back to the howling old owl in the woods
hunting the horny back toad

beyond the yellow brick
road ahahahah ahahah ah

now she's in mealways with me tiny dancer in my hand
e||
jesus freaks out in the street handing tickets out for god
turning back she just laughs the boulevard is not that bad
piano man he makes his stand
in their auditorium
looking on she sings the songs the words she knows
the tune she hums
e||
but oh how it feels so real
lying here with no one near
only you and you can hear me
when i say softly slowly
hold me closer tiny dancer
count the headlights on the highway
lay me down in sheets of linen
you had a busy day today

it's a little bit funny this feeling inside
i'm not one of those who can easily hide
i don't have much money but boy if i did
i'd buy a big house where we both could live
if i was a sculptor but then again no
or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
i know it's not much but it's the best i can do
my gift is my song and this one for you
and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world
e||
i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
well a few of the verses they've got me quite crossed
but the sun's been quite kind while i wrote this song
it's for people like you that they keep turned on
so excuse me forgetting but these i do
you see i've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
anyway the thing is what i reallly mean
yours are the sweetest eyes i've ever seen
and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world
i hope you don't mind i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

i must have been through about a million girls
i'd love 'em then i'd leave 'em alone
i didn't care how much they cried no sir
their tears left me cold as a stone
but then i fooled around and fell in love
i fooled around and fell in love yes i did
i fooled around and fell in love i fooled around and fell in love
it used to be when i'd see a girl that i liked
i'd get out my book and write down her name
but when the grass got a little greener over on the other side
i'd just tear out that page
but then i fooled around and fell in love
i fooled around and fell in love yes i did
i fooled around and fell in love i fooled around and fell in love
free on my own is the way i used to be
ah but since i met you baby love's got a hold on me
it's got a hold on me now i can't let go of you baby
but then i fooled around and fell in love i can t stop loving you now
i fooled around and fell in love yes i did
i fooled around and fell in love i fooled around and fell in love
but then i fooled around and fell in love
i fooled around and fell in love yes i did
i fooled around and fell in love i fooled around and fell in love
oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long girl
and by the way you look i understand that you were not impressed
but i heard you let that little friend of mine
take off your party dress
i'm not gonna get too sentimental
like those other sticky valentines
cause i don't know if you were loving somebody
i only know it isn't mine
alison i know this world is killing you
oh alison my aim is true
well i see you've got a husband now
did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake
you used to hold him right in your hand
but he took all that he could take
sometimes i wish that i could stop you from talking
when i hear those silly things that you say
i think somebody better put out the big light
because i can't stand to see you this way
alison i know this world is killing you
oh alison my aim is true
my aim is true my aim is true repeat to fade
maybe i didn’t treat you
quite as good as i should have
maybe i didn’t love you
quite as often as i could have
little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time
you were always on my mind you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
maybe i didn’t hold you
all those lonely lonely times
and i guess i never told you
i’m so happy that you’re mine
if i made you feel second best
girl i’m so sorry i was blind
you were always on my mind you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
t e ll me tell me that your sweet love hasn’t die ied
g i ve me give me one more chance to keep you satisfie ied satisfied

i've hungered for your touch
a long lonely time
when i was young
i never needed anyone
and makin' love was just for fun
those days are gone
livin' alone
i think of all the friends i've known
but when i dial the telephone
nobody's home
all by myself
don't wanna be all by myself anymore
all by myself
don't wanna live all by myself anymore
hard to be sure
sometimes i feel so insecure
and love so distant and obscure
remains the cure
all by myself
don't wanna be all by myself anymore
all by myself
don't wanna live all by myself anymore
when i was young
i never needed anyone
and makin' love was just for fun
those days are gone
all by myself
don't wanna be all by myself anymore
all by myself
don't wanna live all by myself anymore
all by myself
don't wanna be all by myself anymore
all by myself
don't wanna live all by myself anymore
the falling leaves
drift by my window
the falling leaves
of red and gold
i see your lips
the summer kisses
the sunburned hands
i used to hold
since you went away
the days grow long
and soon i'll hear
old winter's song
but i miss you
most of all
my darling
when autumn leaves
start to fall
bell bottom blues you made me cry
i don't wanna lose this feeling
and if i could choose a place to die
it would be in your arms
do you wanna see me crawl across the floor to you
do you wanna see me beg you to take me back i'd gladly do it 'cause
i don't want to fade away give me one more day please
i don't want to fade away in your heart i long to stay
it's all wrong but it's all right
the way that you treat me baby
once i was strong but i lost the fight
you won't find a better loser
do you wanna see me crawl across the floor to you
do you wanna see me beg you to take me back i'd gladly do it 'cause
i don't want to fade away give me one more day please
i don't want to fade away in your heart i long to stay
do you wanna see me crawl across the floor to you
do you wanna see me beg you to take me back i'd gladly do it 'cause
i don't want to fade away give me one more day please
i don't want to fade away in your heart i long to stay
bell bottom blues don't say goodbye
we're surely gonna meet again
and if we do don't be surprised
if you find me with another lover
do you wanna see me crawl across the floor to you
do you wanna see me beg you to take me back i'd gladly do it 'cause
i don't want to fade away give me one more day please
i don't want to fade away in your heart i long to stay

they say they want to bring me in guilty
for the killing of a deputy
for the life of a deputy but i say play main riff

i shot the sheriff but i swear it was in selfdefense
i shot the sheriff and they say it is a capital offense
sheriff john brown always hated me
for what i don't know
every time that i plant a seed
he said "kill it before it grows"
he said "kill it before it grows" i say
i shot the sheriff but i swear it was in selfdefense
i shot the sheriff but i swear it was in selfdefense

i shot the sheriff but i did not shoot the deputy oh no

lay down sally and rest here in my arms
don't you think you want someone to talk to

and don't you ever leave
lay down sally and rest here in my arms
don't you think you want someone to talk to

i once lived the life of a millionaire
spent all my money didn't have any cares
took all my friends out for a mighty good time
we bought bootleg liquor champagne and wine
than i began to fall so low
lost all my good friends had nowhere to go
if i get my hands on a dollar again
i'll hang on it till that old eagle grins because
nobody knows you
when you're down and out
in your pocket not one penny
and as for friends well you ain't got any
when you get back on your feet again
everybody wants to be your long lost friend
i said it strange without any doubt
nobody knows you when you're down and out
lord nobody knows you
when you're down and out
in your pocket not one penny
and as for friends well you ain't got any
when you get back on your feet again
everybody wants to be your long lost friend
i said it strange without any doubt
nobody knows you
nobody knows you
nobody knows you when you're down and out

it's late in the evening
she's wondering what clothes to wear
she puts on her makeup
and brushes her long blonde hair
and then she asks me
do i look alright
and i say yes you look wonderful tonight
we go to a party
and everyone turns to see
this beautiful lady
that's walking around with me
and then she asks me
do you feel alright
and i say yes i feel wonderful tonight
i feel wonderful
because i see the love light in your eyes
and the wonder of it all
is that you just don't realize
it's time to go home now
and i've got an aching head
so i give her the car keys
she helps me to bed
and then i tell her
as i turn out the light
i say my darling you were wonderful tonight
oh my darling you were wonderful tonight
poor old granddad i laughed at all his words
i thought he was a bitter man he spoke of women's ways
they'll trap you then they use you before you even know
for love is blind and you're far too kind don't ever let it show
i wish that i knew what i know now when i was younger
i wish that i knew what i know now when i was stronger
the can can's such a pretty show they'll steal your heart away
but backstage back on earth again the dressing rooms are grey
they come on strong and it ain't too long before they make you feel a man
but love is blind and you soon will find you're just a boy again
i wish that i knew what i know now when i was younger
i wish that i knew what i know now when i was stronger
when you want her lips you get a cheek makes you wonder where you are
if you want some more and she's fast asleep leaves you twinkling with the stars
poor young grandson there's nothing i can say
you'll have to learn just like me and that's the hardest way
ooh la la
ooh la la la la yeah
i wish that i knew what i know now when i was younger
i wish that i knew what i know now when i was stronger
now here you go again you say you want your freedom
well who am i to keep you down
it's only right that you should play the way you feel it
but listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
like a heartbeat drives you mad
in the stillness of remembering
what you had
and what you lost
what you had
and what you lost
thunder only happens when it's raining
players only love you when they're playing
women they will come and they will go
when the rain washes you clean you'll know
now here i go again i see the crystal vision
i keep my visions to myself
it's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
and have you any dreams you'd like to sell dreams of loneliness
like a heartbeat drives you mad
in the stillness of remembering
what you had
and what you lost
what you had
and what you lost
thunder only happens when it's raining
players only love you when they're playing
women they will come and they will go
when the rain washes you clean you'll know
loving you isn t the right thing to do
how can i ever change things that i feel
if i could maybe i d give you my world
how can i when you wont take it from me
you can go your own way go your own way
you can call it another lonely day
you can go your own way go your own way
tell me why everything turned around
packing up shacking up is all you wanna do
if i could baby id give you my world
open up everything s waiting for you
you can go your own way go your own way
you can call it another lonely day
you can go your own way go your own way
you can go your own way go your own way
you can call it another lonely day
you can go your own way go your own way
you can go your own way go your own way
you can call it another lonely day
you can go your own way go your own way
rock on gold dust woman
take your silver spoon dig your grave
heartless challenge pick your path and i'll pray
wake up in the morning
see your sunrise loves to go down
lousy lovers pick their prey
but they never cry out loud – cry out
well did she make you cry
make you break down
shatter your illusions of love
and is it over now do you know how
pick up the pieces and go home
rock on ancient queen follow those who pale
in your shadow
rulers make bad lovers
you better put your kingdom up for sale – up for sale
well did she make you cry
make you break down
shatter your illusions of love
and is it over now do you know how
pick up the pieces and go home
well did she make you cry
make you break down
shatter your illusions of love
and is it over now do you know how
pick up the pieces and go home
go home go home
i took my love i took it down
climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snowcovered hills
till the landslide brought me down
oh mirror in the sky what is love
can the child within my heart rise above
can i sail through the changin' ocean tides
can i handle the seasons of my li i fe
mm hmm hmm hmm
well i've been afraid of changing 'cause i've
built my life around you
but time makes you bolder even children get older
and i'm getting older too
ahah take my love take it down
climbed a mountain and turn around
if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills
well the landslide will bring it down
and if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills
well a landslide'll bring it down ohohh
the landslide'll bring it down
rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
and wouldn't you love to love her
takes to the sky like a bird in flight
and who will be her lover
all your life you've never seen a woman taken by the wind
would you stay if she promised you heaven
will you ever win
she is like a cat in the night
and then she is the darkness
she rules her life like a fine skylark
and when the sky is starless
all your life you've never seen a woman taken by the wind
would you stay if she promised you heaven
will you ever win
will you ever win
rhi an non
rhi an non
taken by taken by the sky
taken by taken by the sky
dreams unwind loves a state of mind
for you there'll be no more crying
for you the sun will be shining
and i feel that when i'm with you
it's alright i know it's right
to you i'll give the world
to you i'll never be cold
cause i feel that when i'm with you
it's alright i know it's right
and the songbirds are singing
like they know the score
and i love you i love you i love you
like never before
and i wish you all the love in the world
but most of all i wish it from myself
and the songbirds keep singing
like they know the score
and i love you i love you i love you
like never before
like never before
like never before

listen to the wind blow
watch the sun rise
run in the shadows
damn your love damn your lies
and if you don't love me now
you will never love me again
and i can still hear you sayin'
you will never break the chain never break the chain
listen to the wind blow
down comes the night
run in the shadows
damn your love damn your lies
break the silence
damn the dark damn the light
and if you don't love me now
you will never love me again
and i can still hear you sayin'
you will never break the chain never break the chain
chain keep us together
santa lucia per tutti quelli che hanno gli occhi
e un cuore che non basta agli occhi
e per la tranquilla' di chi va per mare
e per ogni lacrima sul tuo vestito
per chi non ha capito
santa lucia per chi beve di notte
e di notte muore e di notte legge
e cade sul suo ultimo metro
e per gli amici che vanno e ritornano indietro
e hanno perduto l'anima e le ali
per chi vive all'incrocio dei venti ed e' bruciato vivo
per le persone facili che non hanno dubbi mai
per la nostra corona di stelle e di spine
e la nostra paura del buio e della fantasia
santa lucia il violino dei poveri
e' una barca sfondata e un ragazzino
al secondo piano che canta ride e stona
perche' vada lontano fa che gli sia dolce
anche la pioggia nelle scarpe anche la solitudine




petite marie je parle de toi
parce qu'avec ta petite voix
tes petites manies tu as versé sur ma vie
des milliers de roses
petite furie je me bats pour toi
pour que dans dix mille ans de ça
on se retrouve à l'abri sous un ciel aussi joli
que des milliers de roses
je viens du ciel et les étoiles entre elles
ne parlent que de toi
d'un musicien qui fait jouer ses mains
sur un morceau de bois
de leur amour plus bleu que le ciel autour
petite marie je t'attends transi
sous une tuile de ton toit
le vent de la nuit froide me renvoie la ballade
que j'avais écrite pour toi
petite furie tu dis que la vie
c'est une bague à chaque doigt
au soleil de floride moi mes poches sont vides
et mes yeux pleurent de froid
je viens du ciel et les étoiles entre elles
ne parlent que de toi
d'un musicien qui fait jouer ses mains
sur un morceau de bois
de leur amour plus bleu que le ciel autour
dans la pénombre de ta rue
petite marie m'entendstu
je n'attends plus que toi pour partir
dans la pénombre de ta rue
petite marie m'entendstu
je n'attends plus que toi pour partir
je viens du ciel et les étoiles entre elles
ne parlent que de toi
d'un musicien qui fait jouer ses mains
sur un morceau de bois
de leur amour plus bleu que le ciel autour

everyone has choice when to and not to raise their voices
it's you that decides
which way you will turn while feeling that our love's not your concern
it's you that decides
noone around you will carry the blame for you
noone around you will love you today and throw it all away
tomorrow when you rise another day for you to realise me
or send me down again
as the days stand up on end
you've got me wondering how i lost your friendship
but i see it in your eyes
though i'm beside you i can't carry the lame for you
i may decide to get out with your blessing where i'll carry on guessing
how high will you leap and will you make enough for you to reap it
only you'll arrive
at your own made end with noone but yourself to be offended
it's you that decides

repeat
what i feel i can't say
but my love is there for you anytime of day
but if it's not love that you need
then i'll try my best to make everything succeed
tell me what is my life without your lo ve
tell me who am i without you by my side
what i know i can do
if i give my love now to everyone like you
but if it's not love that you need
then i'll try my best to make everything succeed
tell me what is my life without your lo ve
tell me who am i without you by my side
tell me what is my life without your lo ve
tell me who am i without you by my side

he said i'll love you 'til i die
she told him you'll forget in time
as the years went slowly by
she still preyed upon his mind
he kept her picture on his wall
went half crazy now and then
he still loved her through it all
hoping she'd come back again
kept some letters by his bed
dated nineteensixtytwo
he had underlined in red
every single i love you
i went to see him just today
oh but i didn't see no tears
all dressed up to go away
first time i'd seen him smile in years
he stopped loving her today
they placed a wreath upon his door
and soon they'll carry him away
he stopped loving her today
you know she came to see him one last time
aw and we all wondered if she would
and it kept running through my mind
this time he's over her for good
he stopped loving her today
they placed a wreath upon his door
and soon they'll carry him away
he stopped loving her today
winding your way down on baker street
lite in your head and dead on your feet
well an other crazy day you drink the night away
and for get about e very thing
this city desert makes you feel so cold it's got
so many people but it's got no soul
and it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong
when you thought it held e very thing
you used to think that it was so ea sy
you used to say that it was so ea sy
but you're tryin you're tryin now
another year and then you'd be ha ppy
just one more year and then you'd be ha ppy
but you're cryin' you're cryin' now
way down the street there's a light in his place
he opens the door he's got that look on his face
and he asks you where you've been you tell him who you've seen
and you talk about a ny thing
he's got this dream a bout buyin' some land
he's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
and then he'll settle down in some quiet little town
and for get about e very thing
but you know he'll always keep mo ving
you know he's never gonna stop mo ving
cause he's rollin' he's the rolling stone
and when you wake up it's a new mor ning
the sun is shining it's a new mor ning
and you're going you're going home
fade
you know i need your love you've got that hold over me
long as i got your love you know that i'll never leave
when i wanted you to share my life i had no doubt in my mind
and it's been you woman right down the line
i know how much i lean on you only you can see
the changes that i've been through have left a mark on me
you've been as constant as a northern star the brightest light that shines
and it's been you woman right down the line
i just want to say this is my way
of telling you everything i could never say before
yeah this is my way
of telling you that every day i'm loving you so much more
'cause you believed in me through my darkest night
put something better inside of me you brought me into the light
threw away all those crazy dreams i put them all behind
and it was you woman right down the line
i just want to say this is my way
of telling you everything i could never say before
yeah this is my way
of telling you that every day i'm loving you so much more
if i should doubt myself if i'm losing ground
i won't turn to someone else they'd only let me down
when i wanted you to share my life i had no doubt in my mind
and it's been you woman right down the line
oooh ooohhhwoooh etc
the page bold the section headings and chords print
in a little while from now
if i'm not feeling any less sour
i promise myself to treat myself
and visit a nearby tower
and climbing to the top
to throw myself off
in an effort to make it clear to whoever what it's like when you're shattered
left standing in the lurch
at a church with people saying
"my god that's tough she stood him up
no point in us remaining
we may as well go home"
as i did on my own
alone again naturally
to think that only yesterday
i was cheerful bright and gay
looking forward who wouldn't do
the role i was about to play
and as if to knock me down
reality came around
and without so much as a mere touch
threw me into little pieces
leaving me to doubt
talk about god in his mercy
who if he really does exist
why did he desert me
in my hour of need
i truly am indeed
alone again naturally
it seems to me that there are more hearts
broken in the world than can be mended
left unattended
what do we do
what do we do
looking back over the years
and whatever else appears
i remember i cried when my father died
never wishing to hide my tears
and at sixtyfive years old
my mother god rest her soul
couldn't understand why the only man
she had ever loved had been taken
leaving her to start
with a heart so badly broken
despite encouragement from me
no words were ever spoken
when she passed away i cried and cried all day
alone again naturally
and fret on the top ewhilst still strumming in time with 'so long' on the
i've been walking these streets so long
i know every crack in the dirty sidewalks of broadway
where hustle is the name of the game
and nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
there's been a load of compromising
on the road to my horizon
but i'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
like a rhinestone cowboy
getting cards letters from people i don't even know
and offers coming over the phone
i really don't mind the rain
you're down while taking the train that's taking the long way
and i dream of things i'll do
with a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
there'll been a load of compromising
on the road to my horizon
but i'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
like a rhinestone cowboy
getting cards letters from people i don't even know
and offers coming over the phone
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
like a rhinestone cowboy
getting cards letters from people i don't even know
and offers coming over the phone

at first i was afraid i was petrified
kept thinking i could never live without you by my side
but then i spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
and i grew strong and i learned how to get along
but now you're back from outer space
i just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
i should have changed that stupid lock
i should have made you leave your key
if i had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
go on now go walk out the door
just turn around now 'cos you're not welcome any more
weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
did you think i'd crumble did you think i'd lay down and die
oh no not i i will survive
oh as long as i know how to love i know i'll stay alive
i've got all my life to live and i've got all my love to give
and i'll survive i will survive i will survive
it took all the strength i had not to fall apart
kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
and i spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
i used to cry but now i hold my head up high
and you see me somebody new
i'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
and so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
well now i'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me
go on now go walk out the door
just turn around now 'cos you're not welcome any more
weren't you the one who tried to crush me with goodbye
did you think i'd crumble did you think i'd lay down and die
oh no not i i will survive
and as long as i know how to love i know i'll stay alive
i've got all my life to live and i've got all my love to give
and i will survive iii will survive
go on now go walk out the door
just turn around now 'cos you're not welcome any more
weren't you the one who tried to crush me with goodbye
did you think i'd crumble did you think i'd lay down and die
no no not i i will survive
and as long as i know how to love i know i'll stay alive
i've got all my life to live and i've got all my love to give
and i'll survive i will survive i will survive
it took all the strength i had not to fall apart

d or play with it for variety


if you could read my mind love
what a tale my thoughts could tell
just like an old time movie
'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
in a castle dark or a fortress strong
with chains upon my feet
you know that ghost is me
and i will never be set free
as long as i'm a ghost that you can't see
if i could read your mind love
what a tale your thoughts could tell
just like a paperback novel
the kind that drugstores sell
when you reach the part where the heartaches come
the hero would be me
but heroes often fail
and you won't read that book again
because the ending's just too hard to take
i'd walk away like a movie star
who gets burned in a three way script
enter number two
a movie queen to play the scene
of bringing all the good things out in me
but for now love let's be real
i never thought i could act this way
and i've got to say that i just don't get it
i don't know where we went wrong
but the feelin's gone
and i just can't get it back
if you could read my mind love
what a tale my thoughts could tell
just like an old time movie
'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
in a castle dark or a fortress strong
with chains upon my feet
but stories always end
and if you read between the lines
you'll know that i'm just tryin' to understand
the feelin's that you lack
i never thought i could feel this way
and i've got to say that i just don't get it
i don't know where we went wrong
but the feelin's gone
and i just can't get it back
e on upstroke if you listen to the recording you'll get the idea
i can see her lyin' back in her satin dress
in a room where ya do what ya don't confess
sundown ya better take care
if i find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
sundown ya better take care
if i find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
she's been lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream
and she don't always say what she really means
sometimes i think it's a shame
when i get feelin' better when i'm feelin' no pain
sometimes i think it's a shame
when i get feelin' better when i'm feelin' no pain
i can picture every move that a man could make
getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake
sundown ya better take care
if i find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
sometimes i think it's a sin
when i feel like i'm winnin' when i'm losin' again
i can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans
she's a hard lovin' woman got me feelin' mean
sometimes i think it's a shame
when i get feelin' better when i'm feelin' no pain
sundown ya better take care
if i find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
sundown ya better take care
if i find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
sometimes i think it's a sin
when i feel like i'm winnin' when i'm losin' again
fade out
the legend lives on from the chippewa on down
of the big lake they called "gitche gumee"
the lake it is said never gives up her dead
when the skies of november turn gloomy
with a load of iron ore twentysix thousand tons more
than the edmund fitzgerald weighed empty
that good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
when the "gales of november" came early
the ship was the pride of the american side
coming back from some mill in wisconsin
as the big freighters go it was bigger than most
with a crew and good captain well seasoned
concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
when they left fully loaded for cleveland
and later that night when the ship's bell rang
could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'
the wind in the wires made a tattletale sound
and a wave broke over the railing
and every man knew as the captain did too
t'was the witch of november come stealin'
the dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
when the gales of november came slashin'
when afternoon came it was freezin' rain
in the face of a hurricane west wind
when suppertime came the old cook came on deck
sayin’ "fellas it's too rough to feed ya"
at seven pm a main hatchway caved in'
he said "fellas it's been good t'know ya"
the captain wired in he had water comin' in
and the good ship and crew was in peril
and later that night when 'is lights went outta sight
came the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald
does any one know where the love of god goes
when the waves turn the minutes to hours
the searches all say they'd have made whitefish bay
if they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
they might have split up or they might have capsized
they may have broke deep and took water
and all that remains is the faces and the names
of the wives and the sons and the daughters
lake huron rolls superior sings
in the rooms of her icewater mansion
old michigan steams like a young man's dreams
the islands and bays are for sportsmen
and farther below lake ontario
takes in what lake erie can send her
and the iron boats go as the mariners all know
with the gales of november remembered
in a musty old hall in detroit they prayed
in the "maritime sailors' cathedral"
the church bell chimed till it rang twentynine times
for each man on the edmund fitzgerald
the legend lives on from the chippewa on down
of the big lake they call "gitche gumee"
"superior" they said "never gives up her dead
when the 'gales of november' come early"
look out of any window
any morning any evening any day
maybe the sun is shining
birds are winging no rain is falling from a heavy sky
what do you want me to do to do for you to see you through
for this is all a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago
walk out of any doorway
feel your way feel your way like the day before
maybe you'll find direction
around some corner where
it's been waiting to meet you
what do you want me to do
to watch for you while you're sleeeeeeeeping
then please don't be surprised when you find me dreaming too
look into any eyes
you find by you you can see clear to another day
maybe been seen before through other eyes
on other days while going home
what do you want me to do to do for you to see you through
it's all a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago
walk into splintered sunlight inch your way through
dead dreams to another land
maybe you're tired and broken your tongue is twisted with
words halfspoken and thoughts unclear
what do you want me to do to do for you to see you through
a box of rain will ease the pain and love will see you through
just a box of rain wind and water
believe it if you need it if you don't just pass it on
sun and shower wind and rain
in and out the window like a moth before a flame
and it's just a box of rain
i don't know who put it there
believe it if you need it or leave it if you dare
and it's just a box of rain
or a ribbon for your hair
such a long long time to be gone
and a short time to be there
fare you well my honey fare you well my only true one
all the birds that were singing are flown except you alone
going to leave this brokedown palace
on my hands and my knees i will roll roll roll
make myself a bed by the waterside
in my time in my time i will roll roll roll
in a bed in a bed
by the waterside i will lay my head
listen to the river sing sweet songs to rock my soul
river going to take me sing me sweet and sleepy
sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home
it's a far gone lullaby sung many years ago
mama mama many worlds i've come since i first left home
goin' home goin' home
by the waterside i will rest my bones
listen to the river sing sweet songs to rock my soul
going to plant a weeping willow
on the bank's green edge it will grow grow grow
sing a lullaby beside the water
lovers come and go the river roll roll roll
fare you well fare you well
i love you more than words can tell
listen to the river sing sweet songs to rock my soul
doo do doo do da do doooo
doo do doo da doo da doo
doo do doo do da do doo da doo
doo do doo da doo da doo
do do doo do doo da doo da doo
gone are the days when the ox fall down
you take up the yoke and plow the fields around
gone are the days when the ladies said "please
gentle jack jones won't you come to me
browneyed women and red grenadine
the bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
and it looks like the old man's gettin' on
when he stepped to the bar
drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
when the wall caved in
he paid his way selling redeyed gin
browneyed women and red grenadine
the bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
and it looks like the old man's gettin' on
delilah jones was the mother of twins
two times over and the rest were sins
raised eight boys only i turned bad
didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had
browneyed women and red grenadine
the bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
and it looks like the old man's gettin' on
tumble down shack in big foot county
snowed so hard that the roof caved in
delilah jones went to meet her god
and the old man never was the same again
daddy made whiskey and he made it well
cost two dollars and it burned like hell
i cut hick'ry just to fire the still
drink down a bottle and be ready to kill
browneyed women and red grenadine
the bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
and it looks like the old man's gettin' on
gone are the days when the ox fall down
you take up the yoke and plow the fiends around
gone are the days when the ladies said' "please
gentle jack jones won't you come to me
browneyed women and red grenadine
the bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
and it looks like the old man's gettin' on
and it looks like the old man's gettin' on


i lit out from reno i was trailed by twenty hounds
didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around
set out runnin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get home before daylight i just might get some sleep tonight
ran into the devil babe he loaned me twenty bills
i spent the night in utah in a cave up in the hills
set out runnin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get home before daylight i just might get some sleep tonight
i ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
he took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air
set out runnin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get home before daylight i just might get some sleep tonight
got two reasons why i cry away each lonely night
the first one's named sweet anne marie and she's my hearts delight
the second one is prison babe the sheriff's on my trail
and if he catches up with me i'll spend my life in jail
got a wife in chino babe and one in cherokee
the first one says she's got my child but it don't look like me
set out runnin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get home before daylight i just might get some sleep tonight
got two reasons why i cry away each lonely night
the first one's named sweet anne marie and she's my hearts delight
the second one is prison babe the sheriff's on my trail
and if he catches up with me i'll spend my life in jail
got a wife in chino babe and one in cherokee
the first one says she's got my child but it don't look like me
set out runnin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get home before daylight i just might get some sleep tonight


if my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
and my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
would you hear my voice come through the music
would you hold it near as it were your own
it's a handmedown the thoughts are broken
perhaps they're better left unsung
i don't know don't really care
let there be songs to fill the air
ripple in still water
when there is no pebble tossed
nor wind to blow
reach out your hand if your cup be empty
if your cup is full may it be again
let it be known there is a fountain
that was not made by the hands of men
there is a road no simple highway
between the dawn and the dark of night
and if you go no one may follow
that path is for your steps alone
ripple in still water
when there is no pebble tossed
nor wind to blow
you who choose to lead must follow
but if you fall you fall alone
if you should stand then who's to guide you
if i knew the way i would take you home
lat da dat da lah daah da da da
la da da la da da da daah da da
lat da dat da lah daah da da da

they said there'll be snow at christmas
i remember one christmas morning
the winter's light and a distant choir
and the peal of a bell and that christmas tree smell
and eyes full of tinsel and fire
they sold me a dream of christmas
and i believed in father christmas
and i looked to the sky with excited eyes
till i woke with a yawn in the first light of dawn
and i saw him and through his disguise
i wish you a hopeful christmas
they said there'd be snow at christmas
they said there'd be peace on earth
hallelujah noel be it heaven or hell
the christmas we get we deserve

country music singers have been a real close family
but lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me
i guess it's because i kind of changed my direction

over and over everybody makes my predictions
so if i get stoned i'm just carrying on an old family tradition
i am very proud of my daddy's name
all though his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same
stop and think it over put yourself in my position
if i get stoned and sing all night long it's a family tradition
so don't ask me hank why do you drink hank why do you roll smoke
why must you live out the songs that you wrote
if i'm down in a honkytonk some ole slick's trying to give me friction
i said leave me alone i'm singing all night long it's a family tradition
lord i have loved some ladies and i have loved jim beam
and they both tried to kill me in
when that doctor asked me son how did you get in this condition
i said hey sawbones i'm just carrying on an ole family tradition
so don't ask me hank why do you drink hank why do you roll smoke
why must you live out the songs that you wrote
stop and think it over try and put yourself in my unique position
if i get stoned and sing all night long it's a family tradition
a child arrived just the other day
he came to the world in the usual way
but there were planes to catch and bills to pay
he learned to walk while i was away
and he was talkin 'fore i knew it and as he grew he'd say
i'm gonna be like you dad
you know i'm gonna be like you
and the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
little boy blue and the man in the moon
when you coming home dad i don't know when
but we'll get together then
you know we'll have a good time then
my son turned ten just the other day
he said thanks for the ball dad c'mon let's play
can you teach me to throw i said "not today
i got a lot to do" he said "that's okay"
and he he walked away but his smile never dimmed he said
"i'm gonna be like him yeah
you know i'm gonna be like him"
and the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
little boy blue and the man in the moon
when you comin' home dad i don't know when
but we'll get together then
you know we'll have a good time then
well he came home college just the other day
so much like a man i just had to say
"son i'm proud of you can you sit for a while"
he shook his head and he said with a smile
"what i'd really like dad is to borrow the car keys
see you later can i have them please"
and the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
little boy blue and the man in the moon
when you comin' home son i don't know when
we'll get together then dad
you know we'll have a good time then
i've long since retired my son's moved away

thump on e bass note between single chord strums
doctor my eyes have seen the years
and the slow parade of fears without crying
now i want to understand
i have done all that i could to see the evil and the good
without hiding you must help me if you can
doctor my eyes tell me what is wrong
was i unwise to leave them open for so long
'cause i have wandered through this world
and as each moment has unfurled i've been waiting
to awaken from these dreams
people go just where they will i never noticed them until
i got this feeling that it's later than it seems
doctor my eyes tell me what you see
i hear their cries just say if it's too late for me
doctor my eyes they cannot see the sky
is this the price for having learned how not to cry
well i've been out walkin'
and i don't do that much talking these days
these days
these days i seem to think a lot
about the things that i forgot to do for you
and all the times i had a chance to
well i had a lover
it's so hard to risk another these days
these days
now if i seem to be afraid
to live the life that i have made in song
well it's just that i have been losing so long
well i'll keep on movin' moving on
things are bound to be improvin' these days
one of these days
these days i sit on corner stones
and count the time in quarter tones to ten my friend
don't confront me with my failures
i had not forgotten them
just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
i walked out this morning and i wrote down this song
i just can't remember who to send it to
i've seen fire and i've seen rain
i've seen sunny days that i thought would never end
i've seen lonely times when i could not find a friend
but i always thought that i'd see you again
won't you look down upon me jesus
you've got to help me make a stand
you've just got to see me through another day
my body's aching and my time is at hand
and i won't make it any other way
oh i've seen fire and i've seen rain
i've seen sunny days that i thought would never end
i've seen lonely times when i could not find a friend
but i always thought that i'd see you again
been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
oh i've seen fire and i've seen rain
i've seen sunny days that i thought would never end
i've seen lonely times when i could not find a friend
but i always thought that i'd see you baby one more time again
thought i'd see you one more time again
there's just a few things coming my way this time around now
thought i'd see you thought i'd see you fire and rain now
there is a young cowboy he lives on the range
his horse and his cattle are his only companions
he works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
waiting for summer his pastures to change
and as the moon rises he sits by his fire
thinkin' about women and glasses of beer
closing his eyes as the dogies retire
he sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
as if maybe someone could hear
goodnight you moonlight ladies
rockabye sweet baby james
deep greens and blues are the colors i choose
won't you let me go down in my dreams
and rockabye sweet baby james
now the first of december was covered with snow
and so was the turnpike from stockbridge to boston
lord the berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frosting
with ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go
there's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
a song that they sing when they take to the sea
a song that they sing of their home in the sky
maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
but singing works just fine for me
goodnight you moonlight ladies
rockabye sweet baby james
deep greens and blues are the colors i choose
won't you let me go down in my dreams
and rockabye sweet baby james

but let's forget all that
and give me the number if you can find it
so i can call just to tell 'em i'm fine and to show
i've overcome the blow i've learned to take it well
i only wish my words could just convince myself
that it just wasn't real but that's not the way it feels
operator oh could you help me place this call
cause i can't read the number that you just gave me
there's something in my eyes you know it happens every time
i think about the love that i thought would save me
isn't that the way they say it goes
but lets forget all that
and give me the number if you can find it
so i can call just to tell 'em i'm fine and to show

i only wish my words could just convince myself
that it just wasn't real but that's not the way it feels
if i could save time in a bottle
the first thing that i'd like to do play riff in reg time
is to save every day till eternity passes away
just to spend them with you
if i could make days last forever
if words could make wishes come true
i'd save every day like a treasure and then
again i would spend them with you
but there never seems to be enough time
to do the things you want to do once you find them
i've looked around enough to know
that you're the one i want to go through time with
if i had a box just for wishes
and dreams that had never come true
the box would be empty except for the memory
of how they were answered by you
but there never seems to be enough time
to do the things you want to do once you find them
i've looked around enough to know
that you're the one i want to go through time with
if i could save time in a bottle
the first thing that i'd like to do play riff in reg time
is to save every day till eternity passes away
just to spend them with you

mother mother ocean i have heard you call
wanted to sail upon your waters since i was three feet tall
you've seen it all you've seen it all
watch the men who rode you switch from sails to steam
and in your belly you hold the treasure that few have ever seen
most of them dreams most of them dreams
yes i am a pirate two hundred years too late
the cannons don't thunder there's nothin' to plunder i'm an over forty victim of fate
arriving too late arriving too late
i've done a bit of smugglin' and i've run my share of grass
i made enough money to buy miami but i pissed it away so fast
never meant to last never meant to last
i have been drunk now for over two weeks
i passed out and i rallied and i sprung a few leaks
but i've got to stop wishin' got to go fishin' i'm down to rock bottom again
with just a few friends just a few friends
i go for younger women lived with several awhile
and though i ran away they'll come back one day i still could manage a smile
it just takes awhile just takes awhile
mother mother ocean after all these years i've found
my occupational hazard being my occupation’s just not around
i feel like i've drowned gonna head uptown
i feel like i've drowned

nibblin' on sponge cake watchin' the sun bake
all of those tourists covered with oil
strummin' my six string on my front porch swing
smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil
wastin' away again in margaritaville searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
some people claim that there's a woman to blame but i know it's nobody's fault
don't know the reason i stayed here all season
nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
but it's a real beauty a mexican cutie
how it got here i haven't a clue
wastin' away again in margaritaville searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
some people claim that there's a woman to blame now i think hell it could be my fault
i blew out my flip flop stepped on a pop top
cut my heel had to cruise on back home
but there's booze in the blender and soon it will render
that frozen concoction that helps me hang on
wastin' away again in margaritaville searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
some people claim that there's a woman to blame but i know it's my own damn fault
yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame and i know it's my own damn fault

like a storm in the desert like a sleepy blue ocean
you fill up my senses come fill me again

let me drown in your laughter let me die in your arms
let me lay down beside you let me always be with you
come let me love you come love me again

come let me love you come love me again
you fill up my senses like a night in a forest
like the mountains in springtime like a walk in the rain
like a storm in the desert like a sleepy blue ocean
you fill up my senses come fill me again
there's a storm across the valley clouds are rolling in
the afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
there's a truck out on the four lane a mile or more away
the whining of his wheels just makes it colder
he's an hour away from riding on your prayers up in the sky
and ten days on the road are barely gone
there's a fire softly burning supper's on the stove
but it's the light in your eyes that makes him warm
hey it's good to be back home again
sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
yes and hey it's good to be back home again
there's all the news to tell him how’d you spend your time
and what's the latest thing the neighbors say
and your mother called last friday sunshine made her cry
and you felt the baby move just yesterday
hey it's good to be back home again yes it is
sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
yes and hey it's good to be back home again
and oh the time that i can lay this tired old body down
and feel your fingers feather soft upon me
the kisses that i live for the love that lights my way
the happiness that living with you brings me
it's the sweetest thing i know of just spending time with you
it's the little things that make a house a home
like a fire softly burning and supper on the stove
and the light in your eyes that makes me warm
hey it's good to be back home again
sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
yes and hey it's good to be back home again
hey it's good to be back home again you know it is
sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
hey it's good to be back home again
yes and hey it's good to be back home again
tall in the saddle we spend christmas day
driving the cattle over snowcovered plains
all of the good gifts given today
ours is the sky and the wide open range
back in the cities they have different ways
football and eggnog and christmas parades
i'll take the blanket i'll take the reins
it's christmas for cowboys and wide open plains
a campfire for warmth as we stop for the night
the stars overhead are christmas tree lights
the wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray
it's christmas for cowboys and wide open plains
tall in the saddle we spend christmas day
driving the cattle over snowcovered plains
so many gifts have been opened today
ours is the sky and the wide open range
it's christmas for cowboys and wide open plains
he was born in the summer of his twenty seventh year
coming home to a place he'd never been before
he left yesterday behind him
you might say he was born again
you might say he found a key for every door
when he first came to the mountains his life was far away
on the road and hanging by a song
but the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
it keeps changing fast and it don't last for long
but the colorado rocky mountain high
i've seen it raining fire in the sky
the shadow from the starlight is softer than a lul la by
rocky mountain high colorado
rocky mountain high colorado
he climbed cathedral mountains he saw silver clouds below
he saw everything as far as you can see
and they say that he got crazy once
and he tried to touch the sun
and he lost a friend but kept the memory
now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
seeking grace in every step he takes
his sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
the serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
and the colorado rocky mountain high
i've seen it raining fire in the sky
talk to god and listen to the casual re ply
rocky mountain high colorado
rocky mountain high colorado
now his life is full of wonder
but his heart still knows some fear
of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
why they try to tear the mountains down
to bring in a couple more
more people more scars upon the land
and the colorado rocky mountain high
i've seen it raining fire in the sky
i know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eag le fly
rocky mountain high
and the colorado rocky mountain high
i've seen it raining fire in the sky
friends around the campfire and every body's high
rocky mountain high colorado
rocky mountain high colorado
rocky mountain high colorado
rocky mountain high colorado
sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
sunshine on the water looks so lovely
sunshine almost always makes me high

i'd sing a song to make you feel this way

life is old there older than the trees younger than the mountains
blowin' like a breeze
country roads take me home to the place i belong
west virginia mountain mama take me home country roads
all my memories gather round her miner's lady stranger to blue water
dark and dusty painted on the sky misty taste of moonshine
teardrop in my eye
country roads take me home to the place i belong
west virginia mountain mama take me home country roads
i hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
the radio reminds me of my home far away
and driving down the road i get a feeling
that i should have been home yesterday yesterday
country roads take me home to the place i belong
west virginia mountain mama take me home country roads
country roads take me home to the place i belong
west virginia mountain mama take me home country roads

as soon as you're born they make you feel small
by giving you no time instead of it all
till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be
they hurt you at home and they hit you at school
they hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be
when they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
then they expect you to pick a career
when you can't really function you're so full of fear
a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be
keep you doped with religion and sex and tv
and you think you're so clever and classless and free
but you're still fucking peasants as far as i can see
a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be
there's room at the top they are telling you still
but first you must learn how to smile as you kill
if you want to be like the folks on the hill
a working class hero is something to be
a working class hero is something to be
if you want to be a hero well just follow me
if you want to be a hero well just follow me
i am an old woman named after my mother
my old man is another child that's grown old
if dreams were lightning and thunder were desire
this old house would've burnt down a long time ago
make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
when i was a young girl i had me a cowboy
he wa'rn't much to look at just a free ramblin' man
but that was a long time and no matter how i try
the years just flow by like a brokendown dam
make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
there's flies in the kitchen i can hear all their buzzin'
but i ain't done nothin' since i woke up today
but how the hell can a person go to work in the morning
come home in the evenin' and have nothin' to say
make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
it was christmas in prison and the food was real good
we had turkey and pistols carved out of wood
and i dream of her always even when i don't dream
her names on my tongue and her bloods in my stream
wait a while eternity
old mother nature's got nothing on me
come to me run to me
come to me now
we're rolling my sweetheart
we're flowing by god
she reminds me of a chess game with someone i admire
or a picnic in the rain after a prairie fire
her heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail
and she sweeter than saccharin at a drug store sale
wait awhile eternity
old mother nature's got nothing on me
come to me run to me
come to me now
we're rolling my sweetheart
we're flowing by god
the search light in the big yard swings round with the gun
and the spotlights in the snowflakeslike the dust in the sun
it's christmas in prison there'll be music tonight
i'll probably get homesick i love you goodnight
wait a while eternity
old mother nature's got nothing on me
come to me run to me
come to me now
we're rolling my sweetheart
we're flowing by god
when i was a child my family would travel
down to western kentucky where my parents were born
and there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
so many times that my memories are worn
and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
down by the green river where paradise lay
well i'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
mr peabody's coal train has hauled it away
well sometimes we'd travel right down the green river
to the abandoned old prison down by adrie hill
where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
but empty pop bottles was all we would kill
and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
down by the green river where paradise lay
well i'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
mr peabody's coal train has hauled it away
then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
and they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
well they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
then they wrote it all down as the progress of man
and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
down by the green river where paradise lay
well i'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
mr peabody's coal train has hauled it away
when i die let my ashes float down the green river
let my soul roll on up to the rochester dam
i'll be halfway to heaven with paradise waitin'
just five miles away from wherever i am
and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
down by the green river where paradise lay
well i'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
mr peabody's coal train has hauled it away
an old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
when all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
aplowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw
their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
for he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry
yippie yi ohhhhh
yippie yi yaaaaay
ghost riders in the sky
their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat
he's riding hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
on horses snorting fire
as they ride on hear their cry
as the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
if you want to save your soul from hell ariding on our range
then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies
yippie yi ohhhhh
yippie yi yaaaaay
ghost riders in the sky
ghost riders in the sky
ghost riders in the sky
well i woke up sunday morning
with no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
and the beer i had for breakfast wasn't bad
so i had one more for dessert
then i fumbled in my closet through my clothes
and found my cleanest dirty shirt
then i washed my face and combed my hair
and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
i'd smoked my mind the night before
with cigarettes and songs i'd been picking
but i lit my first and watched a small kid playing
with the can that he was kicking
then i walked across the street
and caught the sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
and lord it took me back to somethin that i lost somewhere
somehow along the way
on a sunday morning sidewalk
i'm wishing lord that i was stoned
cause there's something in a sunday
that makes the body feel alone
and there's nothing short of dying
that's half as lonesome as the sound
of the sleeping city sidewalks
and sunday morning coming down
in the park i saw a daddy
with a laughing little girl that he was swinging
and listened to the songs that they were singing
then i headed down the street
and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ring ing
and it echoed through the canyons
like our disappearing dreams of yester day
on a sunday morning sidewalk
i'm wishing lord that i was stoned
cause there's something in a sunday
that makes the body feel alone
and there's nothing short of dying
that's half as lonesome as the sound
of the sleeping city sidewalks
and sunday morning coming down
the other night dear as i lay sleeping
i dreamed i held you in my arms
when i awoke dear i was mistaken
so i bowed my head and i cried
you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
you'll never know dear how much i love you
please don't take my sunshine away
i always loved you and made you happy
and nothing else could come between
but now you've left me to love another
you have shattered all my dreams
you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
you'll never know dear how much i love you
please don't take my sunshine away



toute la musique que j'aime
elle vient de là elle vient du blues
les mots ne sont jamais les mêmes
pour exprimer ce qu'est le blues
j'y mets mes joies j'y mets mes peines
et tout ça ça devient le blues
je le chante autant que je l'aime
et je le chanterai toujours
il y a longtemps sur des guitares
des mains noires lui donnaient le jour
pour chanter les peines et les espoirs
pour chanter dieu et puis l'amour
la musique vivra tant que vivra le blues
le blues ça veut dire que je t'aime
et que j'ai mal à en crever
je pleure mais je chante quand même
c'est ma prière pour te garder
toute la musique que j'aime
elle vient de là elle vient du blues
les mots ne sont jamais les mêmes
pour exprimer ce qu'est le blues
j'y mets mes joies j'y mets mes peines
et tout ça ça devient le blues
je le chante autant que je l'aime
et je le chanterai toujours
il y a longtemps sur des guitares
des mains noires lui donnaient le jour
pour chanter les peines et les espoirs
pour chanter dieu et puis l'amour
la musique vivra tant que vivra le blues
le blues ça veut dire que je t'aime
et que j'ai mal à en crever
je pleure mais je chante quand même
c'est ma prière pour te garder

et je le chanterai toujours
a ray of hope flickers in the sky
a tiny star lights up way up high
all across the land dawns a brand new morn
this comes to pass when a child is born
a silent wish sails the seven seas
the winds of change whisper in the trees
and the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn
this comes to pass when a child is born
a rosy hue settles all around
you've got the feel you're on solid ground
for a spell or two noone seems forlorn
this comes to pass when a child is born
it's all a dream an illusion now
it must come true sometime soon somehow
all across the land dawns a brand new morn
this comes to pass when a child is born
i can see clearly now the rain is gone
i can see all obstacles in my way
gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
it's gonna be a bright bright bright bright sun shiny day
it's gonna be a bright bright bright bright sun shiny day
i think i can make it now the pain is gone
all of the bad feelings have disappeared
here is the rainbow i've been praying for
it's gonna be a bright bright bright bright sun shiny day
look all around there's nothing but blue skies
look straight ahead there's nothing but blue skies
i can see clearly now the rain is gone
i can see all obstacles in my way
gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
it's gonna be a bright bright bright bright sun shiny day
it's gonna be a bright bright bright bright sun shiny day
it's gonna be a bright bright bright bright sun shiny day
it's gonna be a bright bright bright bright sun shiny day

just before our love got lost you said "i am as constant as a northern star"
and i said "constantly in the darkness
where's that at if you want me i'll be in the bar"
on the back of a cartoon coaster in the blue tv screen light
i drew a map of canada oh ca na da
with your face sketched on it twice
oh you’re in my blood like holy wine
you taste so bitter and so sweet
oh i could drink a case of you darling
and i would still be on my feet oh i would still be on my feet
e||

oh i am a lonely painter i live in a box of paints
i'm frightened by the devil and i'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
i remember that time that you told me you said
"love is touching souls" surely you touched mine
’cause part of you pours out of me in these lines from time to time
oh you’re in my blood like holy wine
you taste so bitter and so sweet
oh i could drink a case of you darling
still i'd be on my feet i would still be on my feet
e||

i met a woman she had a mouth like yours
she knew your life she knew your devils and your deeds
and she said "go to him stay with him if you can but be prepared to bleed"
oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine
you're so bitter bitter and so sweet
oh i could drink a case of you darling
still i'd be on my feet i would still be on my feet

repeat to fade
it's coming on christmas
they're cutting down trees
they're putting up reindeer
and singing songs of joy and peace
oh i wish i had a river i could skate away on
but it don't snow here
it stays pretty green
i'm going to make a lot of money
then i'm going to quit this crazy scene
oh i wish i had a river i could skate away on
i wish i had a river so long
i would teach my feet to fly wooh
i wish i had a river i could skate away on
i made my baby cry
he tried hard to help me
you know he put me at ease
and he loved me so naughty
made me weak in the knees
oh i wish i had a river i could skate away on
i'm so hard to handle
i'm selfish and i'm sad
now i've gone and lost the best baby
that i ever had
oh i wish i had a river i could skate away on
i wish i had a river so long
i would teach my feet to fly wooh
i wish i had a river i could skate away on
i made my baby say goodbye
it's coming on christmas
they're cutting down trees
they're putting up reindeer
and singing songs of joy and peace
oh i wish i had a river i could skate away on
repeat once each time played
once i rose above the noise and confusion
just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
i was soaring ever higher
but i flew too high
though my eyes could see i still was a blind man
though my mind could think i still was a mad man
i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
i can hear them say
carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
e|||||
masquerading as a man with a reason
my charade is the event of the season
and if i claim to be a wise man
it surely means that i don't know
on a stormy sea of moving emotion
tossed about i'm like a ship on the ocean
i set sail for winds of fortune
but i hear the voices say
carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
e|||||
carry on
you will always remember
carry on
nothing equals the splendor
now your life's no longer empty
surely heaven waits for you
carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry vocal echo don't you cry no more
i close my eyes
only for a moment
and the moment's gone
all my dreams
pass before my eyes a curiosity
dust in the wind
all we are is dust in the wind
same old song
just a drop of water
in the endless sea
all we do
crumbles to the ground
though we refuse to see
dust in the wind
all we are is dust in the wind
now don't hang on
nothing last forever
but the earth and sky
it slips a way
and all your money
won't another minute buy
dust in the wind
all we are is dust in the wind
dust in the wind
everything is dust in the wind
out on the windey windy moors we'd roll and fall in green
you had a temper like my jealousy too hot too greedy
how could you leave me when i needed to possess you
i hated you i loved you too
bad dreams in the night
they told me i was going to lose the fight
leave behind my wuthering wuthering wuthering heights
heathcliff it's me cathy i've come home i'm so cold
let me inayour window
heathcliff it's me cathy i've come home i'm so cold
let me inayour window
oh it gets dark it gets lonely on the other side from you
i pine a lot i find a lot falls through without you
i'm coming back love cruel heathcliff my one dream my only master
too long i roam in the night
i'm coming back to his side to put it right
i'm coming home to wuthering wuthering wuthering heights

joulumaahan matkamies jo moni tietä kysyy
sinne saattaa löytää vaikka paikallansa pysyy
katson taivaan tähtiä ja niiden helminauhaa
itsestäni etsittävä on mun joulurauhaa
joulumaa on muutakin kuin tunturi ja lunta
joulumaa on ihmismielen rauhan valtakunta
eikä sinne matka silloin kovin kauan kestä
joulumaa jos jokaiselta löytyy sydämestä
joulumaasta kuvitellaan paljon kaikenlaista
kuinka toiveet toteutuu ja on niin satumaista
voi jos jostain saada voisin suuren puurokauhan
sillä antaa tahtoisin mä maailmalle rauhan
joulumaa on muutakin kuin pelkkää toiveunta
joulumaa on ihmismielen rauhan valtakunta
eikä sinne matka silloin kovin kauan kestä
joulumaa jos jokaiselta löytyy sydämestä
joulumaasta uskoo moni onnen löytävänsä
mutta sepä kätkeytyy tai narraa etsijäänsä
onnea kun mikään mylly valmiiksi ei jauha
itsestään on löydettävä ihmisen vain rauha
in a bar in toledo across from the depot on a
bar stool she took off her ring
i thought i'd get closer so i walked on over
i sat down and asked her name
quitter but i finally quit livin' on dreams
i'm hungry for laughter and here ever after i'm
after whatever the other life brings
in the mirror i saw him and i closely watched him
i thought how he looked out of place
he came to the woman who sat there beside me
he had a strange look on his face
mountain for a minute i thought i was dead
but he started shaking his big heart was
breaking he turned to the woman and said
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
i've had some bad times lived through some sad times but
this time your hurting won't heal
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
after he left us i ordered more whisky i thought how she'd
made him look small
from the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
we walked without talking at all
she must have thought i'd lost my mind
i couldn't hold her 'cos the words that he told her kept
coming back time after time
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
i've had some bad times lived through some sad times but
this time your hurting won't heal
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
on a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
i met up with the gambler we were both too tired to sleep
so we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'til boredom overtook us and he began to speak
he said "son i've made a life out of readin' people's faces
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
and if you don't mind my sayin' i can see you're out of aces
for a taste of your whiskey i'll give you some advice"
so i handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
and the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
said "if you're gonna play the game boy ya gotta learn to play it right
you got to know when to hold 'em know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away and know when to run
you never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done
ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep"
and when he'd finished speakin' he turned back towards the window
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
and somewhere in the darkness the gambler he broke even
but in his final words i found an ace that i could keep
you got to know when to hold 'em know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away and know when to run
you never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done
you got to know when to hold 'em know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away and know when to run
you never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done
you got to know when to hold 'em know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away and know when to run
you never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done

take the ribbon from your hair
shake it loose and let it fall
layin` soft upon my skin
like the shadows on the wall
come and lay down by my side
`till the early morning light
all i`m taking is your time
help me make it through the night
yesterday is dead and gone
and tomorrow`s out of sight
and it`s sad to be alone
help me make it through the night
i don`t care who`s right or wrong
i don`t try to understand
let the devil take tomorrow
lord tonight i need a friend
well i woke up sunday morning
with no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
wasn't bad so i had one more for dessert
then i fumble through my closet for
my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
and i shaved my face and combed my hair
and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
i'd smoked my brain the night before
on cigarettes and songs that i've been pickin'
cussin' at a can that he was kicking
then i crossed the empty street and caught
the sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
and it took me back to somethin' that
i'd lost somehow somewhere along the way
on the sunday mornin' sidewalks
wishing lord that i was stoned
'cause there is something in a sunday
that makes a body feel alone
and there's nothin' short of dyin'
half as lonesome as the sound
on the sleepin' city sidewalks
sunday mornin' comin' down
in the park i saw a daddy with
a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
and listened to the song that they were singin'
then i headed back for home and
somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
and it echoed thru the canyon like
the disappearing dreams of yesterday
on the sunday mornin' sidewalks
wishing lord that i was stoned
'cause there is something in a sunday
that makes a body feel alone
and there's nothin' short of dyin'
half as lonesome as the sound
on the sleepin' city sidewalks
sunday mornin' comin' down
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
spent my days with a woman unkind
smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
made up my mind to make a new start
going to california with an aching in my heart
someone told me theres a girl out there
with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
took my chances on a big jet plane
never let them tell you that theyre all the same
the sea was red and the sky was grey
wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
the mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake
seems that the wrath of the gods
i think i might be sinking
throw me a line if i reach it in time
runs straight and high
to find a queen without a king
they say she plays guitar and cries as she sings
ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
tryin to find a woman whos never never never been born
standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
telling myself its not as hard hard hard as it seems
oh let the sun beat down upon my face stars to fill my dream
i am a traveler of both time and space to be where i have been
to sit with elders of the gentle race this world has seldom seen
they talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed
talk and song from tongues of lilting grace whose sounds caress my ear
but not a word i heard could i relate the story was quite clear
oh oh
oh i been flying mama there ain't no denyin'
i've been flying ain't no denyin' no denyin' vocal improv
all i see turns to brown as the sun burns the ground
and my eyes fill with sand as i scan this wasted land
trying to find trying to find where i've been
oh pilot of the storm who leaves no trace like thoughts inside a dream
heed the path that led me to that place yellow desert stream
my shangrila beneath the summer moon i will return again
sure as the dust that floats high in june when movin' through kashmir
oh father of the four winds fill my sails across the sea of years
with no provision but an open face along the straits of fear
ohh ooh
when i'm on when i'm on my way yeah
when i see when i see the way you stay yeah
ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah when i'm down
ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah well i'm down so down
ooh my baby oooh my baby let me take you there

there’s a lady who’s sure
all that glitters is gold
and she’s buying a stairway to heaven
when she gets there she knows
if the stores are all closed
with a word she can get what she came for
and she’s buying a stairway to heaven
there’s a sign on the wall
but she wants to be sure
‘cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
in a tree by the brook
there’s a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
and it makes me wonder
and it makes me wonder
there’s a feeling i get
when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts i have seen
rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking
and it makes me wonder
and it makes me wonder
and it’s whispered that soon
if we all call the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn
for those who stand long
and the forests will echo with laughter
and as we wind on down the road
our shadows taller than our souls
there walks a lady we all know
who shines white light and wants to show
how everything still turns to gold
and if you listen very hard
the tune will come to you at last
when all are one and one is all
to be a rock and not a roll
i remember you well in the chelsea hotel
you were talking so brave and so sweet
giving me head on the unmade bed
while the limousines wait in the street
those were the reasons and that was new york
we were running for the money and the flesh
and that was called love for the workers in song
probably still is for those of them left
ah but you got away didn't you babe
you just turned your back on the crowd
you got away i never once heard you say
"i need you i don't need you
i need you i don't need you"
and all of that jiving around
i remember you well in the chelsea hotel
you were famous your heart was a legend
you told me again you preferred handsome men
but for me you would make an exception
and clenching your fist for the ones like us
who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
you fixed yourself you said "well never mind
we are ugly but we have the music"
and then you got away didn't you baby
you just turned your back on the crowd
you got away i never once heard you say
"i need you i don't need you
i need you i don't need you"
and all of that jiving around
i don't mean to suggest that i loved you the best
i can't keep track of each fallen robin
i remember you well in the chelsea hotel
that's all i don't even think of you that often
it's four in the morning the end of december
i'm writing you now just to see if you're better
new york is cold but i like where i'm living
there's music on clinton street all through the evening
i hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
you're living for nothing now i hope you're keeping some kind of record
yes and jane came by with a lock of your hair
she said that you gave it to her that night that you planned to go clear
did you ever go clear
ah the last time we saw you you looked so much older
your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
you'd been to the station to meet every train
and you came home without lili marlene
and you treated my woman to a flake of your life
and when she came back she was nobody's wife
well i see you there with the rose in your teeth
one more thin gypsy thief well i see jane's awake
she sends her regards
and what can i tell you my brother my killer
what can i possibly say
i guess that i miss you i guess i forgive you
i'm glad you stood in my way
if you ever come by here for jane or for me
well your enemy is sleeping and his woman is free
yes and thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes
i thought it was there for good so i never tried
and jane came by with a lock of your hair
she said that you gave it to her that night that you planned to go clear
sincerely l cohen
frankie laine he was singing jezebel
i pinned an iron cross to my lapel
i walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
i said "look you don't know me
now but very soon you will
so won't you let me see"
i said "won't you let me see"
i said "won't you let me see
your naked body"
"just dance me to the dark side of the gym
chances are i let you do most anything
i know you're hungry i can hear it in your voice
and there are many parts of
me to touch you have your choice
ah but no you cannot see
she said "no you cannot see
she said "no you cannot see
my naked body"
so we're dancing close the band is playing stardust
balloons and paper streamers they are floating down on us
she says "you've got a minute left to fall in love"
in solemn moments such as this i have put my trust
and all my faith to see
i said all my faith to see
i said all my faith to see
her naked body
her naked body
her naked body
her naked body
her naked body
her naked body
i feel so bad i got a worried mind i'm so lonesome all the time
since i left my baby behind on blue bayou
saving nickels saving dimes working till the sun don't shine
looking forward to happier times on blue bayou
i'm going back someday come what may to blue bayou
where the folks are fine and the world is mine on blue bayou
where those fishing boats with their sails afloat if i could only see
that familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy i'd be
gonna see my baby again gonna be with some of my friends
maybe i'll feel better again on blue bayou
saving nickels saving dimes working till the sun don't shine
looking forward to happier times on blue bayou
i'm going back someday come what may to blue bayou
where the folks are fine and the world is mine on blue bayou
where those fishing boats with their sails afloat if i could only see
that familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy i'd be
oh that boy of mine by my side the silver moon and the evening time
oh some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside
well i'd never be blue my dreams come true
on blue bayou
i've been warped by the rain
driven by the snow
drunk and dirty don't you know
but i'm still willin
and i was out on the road
late at night
seen my pretty alice in every headlight
alice dallas alice
and i been from tucson to tucumcari
tehachapi to tonapa
driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
driven the back roads so i wouldn't get weighed
and you show me a sign
i'll be willin' to be movin'
kicked by the wind
robbed by the sleet
had my head stoved in but i'm still on my feet
and i'm still in a whole lot of trouble
smuggled some smokes and folks from mexico
baked by the sun
every time i go to mexico
and i'm still
and i been from tucson to tucumcari
tehachapi to tonapa
driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
driven the back roads so i wouldn't get weighed
and you show me a sign
i'll be willin' to be movin'

there's a port on a western bay
and it serves a hundred ships a day
lonely sailors pass the time away
and talk about their homes
and there's a girl in this harbor town
and she works layin' whiskey down
they say brandy fetch another round
she serves them whiskey and wine
the sailors say brandy you're a fine girl you’re a fine girl
what a good wife you would be such a fine girl
your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea dodo
brandy wears a braided chain
made of finest silver from the north of spain
a locket that bears the name
of the man that brandy loves
he came on a summer's day
bringing gifts from far away
but he made it clear he couldn't stay
no harbor was his home
the sailors say brandy you're a fine girl you’re a fine girl
what a good wife you would be such a fine girl
but my life my lover my lady is the sea dodo
yeah brandy used to watch his eyes
when he told his sailor's stories
she could feel the ocean fall and rise
she saw it's raging glory
but he had always told the truth
lord he was an honest man
and brandy does her best to understand dodo
at night when the bars close down
brandy walks through a silent town
and loves a man who's not around
she still can hear him say she hears him say
she hears him say brandy you're a fine girl you’re a fine girl
what a good wife you would be such a fine girl
but my life my lover my lady is the sea dodo
say brandy you're a fine girl you’re a fine girl
what a good wife you would be such a fine girl
but my life my lover my lady is the sea dodo
just a perfect day
drink sangria in the park
and then later when it gets dark

then later a movie too
and then home

oh such a perfect day

i'm glad i spent it with you
oh such a perfect day

por la blanda arena
que lame el mar
no vuelve más
un sendero solo
de pena y silencio llegó
hasta el agua profunda
un sendero solo
de penas mudas llegó
hasta la espuma
sabe dios qué angustia
te acompañó
qué dolores viejos
calló tu voz
para recostarte
arrullada en el canto
de las caracolas marinas
la canción que canta
en el fondo oscuro del mar
la caracola
te vas alfonsina
con tu soledad
¿qué poemas nuevos
fuíste a buscar
una voz antigüa
de viento y de sal
te requiebra el alma
y la está llevando
y te vas hacia allá
como en sueños
dormida alfonsina
vestida de mar
cinco sirenitas
te llevarán
por caminos de algas
y de coral
y fosforescentes
caballos marinos harán
una ronda a tu lado
y los habitantes
del agua van a jugar
pronto a tu lado
bájame la lámpara
un poco más
déjame que duerma
nodriza en paz
y si llama él
no le digas que estoy
dile que alfonsina no vuelve
y si llama él
no le digas nunca que estoy
di que me he ido
te vas alfonsina
con tu soledad
¿qué poemas nuevos
fuiste a buscar
una voz antigüa
de viento y de sal
te requiebra el alma
y la está llevando
y te vas hacia allá
como en sueños
dormida alfonsina
vestida de mar

some things in life are bad they can really make you mad
other things just make you swear and curse
when you're chewing on life's gristle
don't grumble give a whistle
and this'll help things turn out for the best
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the light side of life
if life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
when you're feeling in the dumps don't be silly chumps
just purse your lips and whistle that's the thing
and always look on the bright side of life
come on always look on the bright side of life
for life is quite absurd and death's the final word
you must always face the curtain with a bow
forget about your sin give the audience a grin
enjoy it it's your last chance anyhow
so always look on the bright side of death
just before you draw your terminal breath
life's a piece of shit when you look at it
life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true
you'll see it's all a show
keep 'em laughing as you go
just remember that the last laugh is on you
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
try to imagine a house thats not a home
and try to imagine a christmas all alone
thats where i'll be since you left me
my tears could melt the snow
what can i do without you
ive got no place to go
it'll be lonely this christmas without you to hold
it'll be lonely this christmas lonely and cold
itll be cold so cold without you to hold this christmas
each time i remember the day you went away
and how i never listened to the things you had to say
i just break down when i look around
the only things i see
are emptiness and loneliness and a humbling christmas tree
it'll be lonely this christmas without you to hold
it'll be lonely this christmas lonely and cold
itll be cold so cold without you to hold this christmas
it'll be lonely this christmas without you to hold
it'll be lonely this christmas lonely and cold
itll be cold so cold without you to hold this christmas

love hurts love scars love wounds and mars

love is like a cloud it holds a lot of rain
love hurts ooh hoo love hurts
i'm young i know but even so
i know a thing or two i learned from you
i really learned a lot really learned a lot
love is like a flame it burns you when it's hot

some fools think of happiness blissfulness togetherness
some fools fool themselves i guess

where it began i can't begin to knowin'
but then i know it's growin' strong
was in the spring and spring became a summer
who'd have believed you'd come along
hands touching hands
reaching out touching me touching you
sweet caroline good times never seemed so good
i've been inclined to believe they never would
but now i
look at the night and it don't seem so lonely
we fill it up with only two
and when i hurt hurting runs off my shoulder
how can i hurt when holding you
warm touching warm
reaching out touching me touching you
sweet caroline good times never seemed so good
i've been inclined to believe they never would
oh no no
sweet caroline good times never seemed so good
sweet caroline i believe they never could
well i dreamed i saw the knights in armour coming
sayin' something about a queen
there where peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
and the archer split the tree
there was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
that was floating on the breeze
look at mother nature on the run
in the nineteen seventies
look at mother nature on the run
in the nineteen seventies
i was lying in a burned out basement
with a full moon in my eye
i was hoping for replacement
when the sun burst through the sky
there was a band playing in my head
and i felt like getting high
i was thinking about what a friend had said
i was hoping it was a lie
thinking about what a friend had said
i was hoping it was a lie
well i dreamed i saw the silver spaceship flying
in the yellow haze of the sun
there were children crying and colors flying
all around the chosen one
all in a dream all in a dream
the loading had begun
flying mother nature's silver seed
to a new home in the sun
flying mother nature's silver seed
to a new home
in other words hammeron the first string as you hit the opening d
comes a time when you’re driftin’
comes a time when you settle down
comes a light feelings liftin’
lift that baby right up off the ground
oh this old world keeps spinnin’ ‘round
it’s a wonder tall trees ain’t laying down
there comes a time
you and i we were captured
we took our souls and we flew away
we were right we were giving
that’s how we kept what we gave away
oh this old world keeps spinnin’ ‘round
it’s a wonder tall trees ain’t laying down
there comes a time
there comes a time
there comes a time
there comes a time
there comes a time
he came dancing across the water
with his galleons and guns
looking for the new world
in that palace in the sun
on the shore lay montezuma
with his coca leaves and pearls
in his halls he often wandered
with the secrets of the worlds
and his subjects gathered 'round him
like the leaves around a tree
in their clothes of many colours
for the angry gods to see
and the women all were beautiful
and the men stood straight and strong
they offered life in sacrifice
so that others could go on
hate was just a legend
and war was never known
the people worked together
and they lifted many stones
they carried them to the flatlands
but they died along the way
and they built up with their bare hands
what we still can't do today
and i know she's living there
and she loves me to this day
i still can't remember when
or how i lost my way
he came dancing across the water
cortez cortez
what a killer
fade out
old man lying by the side of the road
with the lorries rolling by
blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
and the buildings scrape the sky
cold wind rippling down the alley at dawn
and the morning paper fly
dead man lying at the side of the road
and the daylight in his eyes
don't let it bring you down
it's only castles burning
find someone who's turning
and you will come around
blind man running through the light of the night
with an answer in his hand
come on down to the river of sight and
you can really understand
red light flashin' through the window in the rain
can you hear the sirens moan
white cane lying in the gutter in the lane
and you're walking home alone
don't let it bring you down
it's only castles burning just
find someone who's turning
and you will come around
don't let it bring you down
it's only castles burning just
find someone who's turning
and you will come around
or retune your guitar to d and change accordingly
i think i'll go out to alberta
weather's good there in the fall
i've got some friends that i can go working for
still i wish you'd change your mind
if i ask you one more time
but we've been through that a hundred times or more
four strong winds that blow lonely
seven seas that run high
all those things that don't change
come what may
if the good times are all gone
then i'm bound for moving on
i'll look for you if i'm ever back this way
if i get there before the snow flies
and if things are looking good
you could meet me if i sent you down the fare
but by then it would be winter
not too much for you to do
and those winds sure can blow cold way out there
four strong winds that blow lonely
seven seas that run high
all those things that don't change
come what may
if the good times are all gone
then i'm bound for moving on
i'll look for you if i'm ever back this way
still i wish you'd change your mind
if i ask you one more time
but we've been through that a hundred times or more
four strong winds that blow lonely
seven seas that run high
all those things that don't change
come what may
if the good times are all gone
then i'm bound for moving on
i'll look for you if i'm ever back this way
i'll look for you if i'm ever back this way
did i see you down in a young girl's town
with your mother in so much pain
i was almost there at the top of the stairs
with her screamin' in the rain
did she wake you up to tell you that
it was only a change of plan
dream up dream up let me fill your cup
with the promise of a man
did i see you walking with the boys
though it was not hand in hand
and was some black face in a lonely place
when you could understand
did she wake you up to tell you that
it was only a change of plan
dream up dream up let me fill your cup
with the promise of a man
will i see you give more than i can take
will i only harvest some
as the days fly past will we lose our grasp
or fuse it in the sun
did she wake you up to tell you that
it was only a change of plan
dream up dream up let me fill your cup
with the promise of a man
dream up dream up let me fill your cup
with the promise of a man


i want to live i want to give
i've been a miner for a heart of gold
it's these expressions i never give
that keep me searching for a heart of gold
and i'm getting old
keep me searching for a heart of gold
and i'm getting old

i've been to hollywood i've been to redwood
i've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
i've been in my mind it's such a fine line
that keeps me searching for a heart of gold
and i'm getting old
that keeps me searching for a heart of gold
and i'm getting old
keep me searching for a heart of gold
you keep me searching and i'm growin' old
keep me searching for a heart of gold
i've been a miner for a heart of gold ahhhhhh

we've been through some things together
with trunks of memories still to come
we found things to do in stormy weather
long may you run
long may you run long may you run
although these changes have come
with your chrome heart shinin' in the sun
long may you run break

well it was back in blind river in nineteen sixtytwo
when i last saw you alive
but we missed that shift on the long decline
long may you run
long may you run long may you run
although these changes have come
with your chrome heart shinin' in the sun
long may you run break
maybe the beach boys have got you now
with those waves singin' caroline
rollin' down that empty ocean road
get into the surf on time
long may you run long may you run
although these changes have come
with your chrome heart shinin' in the sun
long may you run break

e|x|x|mute with thumb
old man look at my life i'm a lot like you were
old man look at my life i'm a lot like you were
old man look at my life
twenty four and there's so much more
live alone in a paradise
that makes me think of two
love lost such a cost
give me things that don't get lost
like a coin that won't get tossed
rollin' home to you
old man take a look at my life i'm a lot like you
i need someone to love me the whole day through
oh one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true
lullabies look in your eyes
run around the same old town
doesn't mean that much to me
to mean that much to you
i've been first and last
look at how the time goes past
but i'm all alone at last
rolling home to you
old man look at my life i'm a lot like you were
old man look at my life i'm a lot like you were
when you were young and on your own
how did it feel to be alone
i was always thinking of games that i was playing
trying to make the best of my time
but only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes only love can break your heart
what if your world should fall apart
i have a friend i've never seen
he hides his head inside a dream
someone should call him and see if he can come out
try to lose the down that he's found
but only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes only love can break your heart
what if your world should fall apart
i have a friend i've never seen
he hides his head inside a dream
yes only love can break your heart to fade
think i'll pack it in and buy a pickup
take it down to la
find a place to call my own and try to fix up
start a brand new day
the woman i'm thinking of she loved me all up
but i'm so down today
i hear her calling
see the lonely boy out on the weekend
trying to make it pay
can't relate to joy he tries to speak and
can't begin to say
she got pictures on the wall they make me look up
from her big brass bed
now i'm running down the road trying to stay up
somewhere in her head
the woman i'm thinking of she loved me all up
but i'm so down today
i hear her calling
see the lonely boy out on the weekend
trying to make it pay
can't relate to joy he tries to speak and
can't begin to say
look out ma there's a white boat comin' up the river
with a big red beacon and a flag and a man on the rail
i think you'd better call john
'cause it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail
and it's less than a mile away
i hope they didn't come to stay
it's got numbers on the side and a gun
and it's makin' big waves

daddy's gone and my brother's out huntin' in the mountains
big john's been drinkin' since the river took emmy lou
so the powers that be left me here to do the thinkin'
and i just turned twentytwo
i was wonderin' what to do
and the closer they got
the more those feelin's grew

daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassurin’
he told me "red means run son and numbers add up to nothin'"
when the first shot hit the dock i saw it comin'
raised my rifle to my eye
never stopped to wonder why
then i saw black and my face splashed in the sky

shelter me from the powder and the finger
cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger
just think of me as one you never figured
would fade away so young
so much left undone
remember me to my love i know i'll miss her

oh to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon
it's so noisy at the fair
but all your friends are there
and the candy floss you had
and your mother and your dad
oh to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon
there's a girl just down the aisle
oh to turn and see her smile
you can hear the words she wrote
as you read the hidden note
oh to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon
now you're underneath the stairs
and you're giving back some glares
to the people who you met
and it's your first cigarette
oh to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon
now you say you're leaving home
'cause you want to be alone
ain't it funny how you feel
when you're finding out it's real
oh to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon
oh to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
sailing heartships through broken harbors
out on the waves in the night
still the searcher must ride the dark horse
racing alone in his fright
tell me why

is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
when you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell

tell me why

"the problem is all inside your head" she said to me
the answer is easy if you take it logically
i'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
there must be fifty ways to leave your lover"
she said "it's really not my habit to intrude
furthermore i hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
but i'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude

when i think back
on all the crap i learned in high school
it's a wonder
i can think at all
and though my lack of education
hasn't hurt me none
i can read the writing on the wall

i love to take a photograph
so mama don't take my kodachrome away
if you took all the girls i knew
when i was single
and brought them all together for one night
i know they'd never match
my sweet imagination
and everything looks worse in black and white

the mama pajama rolled out of bed
and she ran to the police station
when the papa found out he began to shout
and he started the investigation
it's against the law
it was against the law
what the mama saw
it was against the law
the mama looked down and spit on the ground
every time my name gets mentioned
the papa said oy if i get that boy
i'm gonna stick him in the house of detention
well i'm on my way
i don't know where i'm going
i'm on my way i'm taking my time

i met my old lover on the street last night
she seemed so glad to see me i just smiled
and we talked about some old times and we drank ourselves some beers
still crazy after all these years oh
still crazy after all these years
i’m not the kind of man who tends to socialize
i seem to lean on old familiar ways
and i aint no fool for love songs that whisper in my ears
still crazy after all these years oh
still crazy after all these years
four in the morning crapped out yawn ing
longing my life away
i’ll never worry why should i
it’s all gonna fade
now i sit by my window and i watch the cars
i fear i’ll do some damage one fine day
but i would not be convicted by a jury of my peers
still crazy after all these years oh
still crazy still crazy
still crazy after all these years

shadows grow so long before my eyes and they're moving across the page
suddenly the day turns into night far away from the city
but don't hesitate cause your love won't wait
ooh baby i love your way
wanna tell you i love your way
wanna be with you night and day
moon appears to shine and light the sky with the help of some firefly
wonder how they have the power to shine shine shine
i can see them under the pine
but don't hesitate cause your love won't wait
ooh baby i love your way
wanna tell you i love your way
wanna be with you night and day
i can see the sunset in your eyes brown and grey and blue besides
clouds are stalking islands in the sun i wish i could buy one out of season
but don't hesitate cause your love won't wait
ooh baby i love your way
wanna tell you i love your way
wanna be with you night and day
ooh baby i love your way
i wonder how you're feeling
there's ringing in my ears
and no one to relate to 'cept the sea
who can i believe in
i'm kneeling on the floor
there has to be a force
who do i phone
the stars are out and shining
but all i really want to know
oh won't you show me the way every day
i want you to show me the way yeah
well i can see no reason
you're living on your nerves
when someone drops a cup and i submerge
i'm swimming in a circle
i feel i'm going down
there has to be a fool to play my part
someone thought of healing
but all i really want to know
oh won't you show me the way every day
i want you to show me the way oh
i want you day after day yeah
yeah i wonder if i'm dreaming
i feel so unashamed
i can't believe this is happening to me

oh won't you show me the way every day
i want you to show me the way one more time
i want you day after day hey

climbing up on solsbury hill
i could see the city light
wind was blowing time stood still
eagle flew out of the night
he was something to observe
came in close i heard a voice
standing stretching every nerve
i had to listen had no choice
i did not believe the information
just had to trust imagination
my heart going boom boom boom
grab your things i've come to take you home
to keeping silence i resigned
my friends would think i was a nut
turning water into wine
open doors would soon be shut
so i went from day to day
though my life was in a rut
'till i thought of what i'd say
which connection i should cut
i was feeling part of the scenery
i walked right out of the machinery
my heart was going boom boom boom
hey he said
grab your things i've come to take you home
when illusion spin her net
i'm never where i want to be
and liberty she pirouette
when i think that i am free
watched by empty silhouettes
who close their eyes but still can see
no one taught them etiquette
i will show another me
today i don't need a replacement
i'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
my heart going boom boom boom
hey i said
you can keep my things they've come to take me home

fade out
the lunatic is on the grass
the lunatic is on the grass
remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
got to keep the loonies on the path
the lunatic is in the hall
the lunatics are in my hall
the paper holds their folded faces to the floor
and every day the paper boy brings more
and if the dam breaks open many years too soon
and if there is no room upon the hill
and if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
i'll see you on the dark side of the moon
the lunatic is in my head laughter
the lunatic is in my head
you raise the blade you make the change
you rearrange me 'till i'm sane
you lock the door
and throw away the key
there's someone in my head but it's not me
and if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
you shout and no one seems to hear
and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
i'll see you on the dark side of the moon

breathe breathe in the air
don't be afraid to care
leave don't leave me
look around and choose your own ground
long you live and high you fly
smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
all you touch and all you see
is all your life will ever be
run rabbit run
dig that hole forget the sun
and when at last the work is done
don't sit down it's time to dig another one
for long you live and high you fly
but only if you ride the tide
and balanced on the biggest wave
you race towards an early grave
hello
is there anybody in there
just nod if you can hear me
is there anyone home
i hear you're feeling down
well i can ease your pain
get you on your feet again
i need some information first
just the basic facts
can you show me where it hurts
there is no pain you are receding
a distant ships smoke on the horizon
you are only coming through in waves
your lips move but i can't hear what you re saying
when i was a child i had a fever
my hands felt just like two balloons
now i got that feeling once again
i can't explain you would not understand
this is not how i am
i have become comfortably numb
i have become comfortably numb
ok ok
just a little pinprick
there'll be no more aaaaaahhhhh
but you may feel a little sick
i do believe it's working good
that'll keep you going for the show
come on it's time to go
there is no pain you are receding
a distant ship's smoke on the horizon
you are only coming through in waves
your lips move but i can't hear what you're saying
when i was a child i caught a fleeting glimpse
out of the corner of my eye
i turned to look but it was gone
i cannot put my finger on it now
the child is grown the dream is gone
i have become comfortably numb
you gotta be crazy you gotta have a real need
gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
you gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
you gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking
and after a while you can work on points of style
like the club tie and the firm handshake
you have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
so that when they turn their backs on you
you've gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
you know it's gonna get harder harder and harder as you get older
and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south hide your head in the sand
just another sad old man all alone and dying of cancer
half tempo
guitar solo ad lib
and when you lose control you'll reap the harvest you have sown
and as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone
and it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
so have a good drown as you go down all alone
dragged down by the stone
gotta admit that i'm a little bit confused
sometimes it seems to me as if i'm just being used
gotta stay awake gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
if i don't stand my own ground how can i find my way out of the maze
deaf dumb and blind you just keep on pretending
that everyone's expendable and noone has a real friend
and it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
and everything's done under the sun
who was born in a house full of pain
who was trained not to spit in the fan
who was told what to do by the man
who was broken by trained personnel
who was fitted with collar and chain
who was given a pat on back
who was breaking away from the pack
who was only a stranger at home
who was ground down in the end
who was found dead on the phone
who was dragged down by the stone
who was dragged down by the stone
overhead the albatross
hangs motionless upon the air
and deep beneath the rolling waves
in labyrinths of coral caves
the echo of a distant time
comes willowing across the sand
and everything is green and submarine
and noone showed us to the land
and noone knows the wheres or whys
but something stirs and something tries
and starts to climb towards the light
strangers passing in the street
by chance two separate glances meet
and i am you and what i see is me
and do i take you by the hand
and lead you through the land
and help me understand the best i can
and noone calls us to move on
and noone forces down our eyes
and noone speaks and noone tries
and noone flies around the sun
cm vamp with some fm
cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
inviting and inciting me to rise
and through the window in the wall
come streaming in on sunlight wings
a million bright ambassadors of morning
and noone sings me lullabies
and noone makes me close my eyes
so i throw the windows wide
and call to you across the sky
hey you out there in the cold
getting lonely getting old can you feel me
hey you standing in the aisles
with itchy feet and fading smiles can you feel me
hey you don't you help them to bury the liiight
don't give in without a fight
hey you out there on your own
sitting naked by the phone would you touch me
hey you with your ear against the wall
waiting for someone to call out would you touch me
hey you would you help me to carry the stooone
open your heart i'm coming home
but it was only a fantasy
the wall was too high as you can see
no matter how he tried he could not break free
and the worms ate into his brain
hey you out there on the road
always doing what you're told can you help me
hey you out there beyond the wall
breaking bottles in the hall can you help me
hey you don't tell me there's no hope at aaall
together we stand divided we fall
money get away
new car caviar four star daydream
think i'll buy me a football team
money get back
i'm in the highfidelity first class travelling set
and i think i need a lear jet
money it's a crime
but if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
giving none away
"huhuh i was in the right"

mother did it need to be so high
i've got a little black book with my poems in
got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
when i'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
i got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
got those swollen hand blues
got thirteen channels of shit on the tv to choose from
i've got electric light
and i've got second sight
and amazing powers of observation
and that is how i know
when i try to get through
on the telephone to you
there'll be nobody home
i've got the obligatory hendrix perm
and the inevitable pinhole burns
all down the front of my favourite satin shirt
i've got nicotine stains on my fingers
i've got a silver spoon on a chain
i've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
i've got wild staring eyes
and i've got a strong urge to fly
but i got nowhere to fly to fly to fly to fly to fly to fly to fly to fly to
ooooh babe when i pick up the phone
there's still nobody home
i've got a pair of gohills boots
and i got fading roots


if you didn't care
what happened to me
and i didn't care
for you
we would zigzag our way
through the boredom and pain
occasionally glancing up through the rain
wondering which of the buggers to blame
and watching for pigs on the wing
or
or
as i reach for a peach
slide a line down behind a sofa in san tropez
breaking a stick with a brick on the sand
riding a wave in the wake of an old sedan
sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness
scratched by the sand that fell from my love
deep in my dreams and i still hear her calling
if you're alone i'll come home
backward and homebound the pigeon the dove
gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane
born in a home with no silver spoon
i'm drinking champagne like a good tycoon
sooner than wait for a break in the weather
i'll gather my far flung thoughts together
speeding away on a wind to a new day
if you're alone i'll come home
and i'll pause for a while by a country stile
and listen to the things they say
digging for gold in a hole in my hand
open the book take a look at the way things stand
and you're leading me down to the place by the sea
i hear your soft voice calling to me
making a date for later by phone
and if you're alone i'll come home
or but that won't highlight

ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
waiting for someone or something to show you the way
tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
and then one day you find ten years have got behind you
no one told you when to run you missed the starting gun
and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
racing around to come up behind you again
the sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
shorter of breath and one day closer to death
every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time
plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way
the time is gone the song is over thought i'd something more to say
home home again
i like to be here when i can
when i come home cold and tired
it's good to warm my bones beside the fire
far away across the field
tolling on the iron bell
calls the faithful to their knees
to hear the softly spoken magic spell
us and them
and after all we're only ordinary men
me and you
god only knows it's not what we would choose to do
forward he cried from the rear
and the front rank died
the general sat and the lines on the map
moved from side to side
black and blue
and who knows which is which and who is who
up and down
and in the end it's only round and round and round
"haven't you heard it's a battle of words"
the poster bearer cried
"listen son" said the man with the gun
"there's room for you inside"
down and out
it can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
with without
and who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about
out of the way it's a busy day
i've got things on my mind
for the want of the price of tea and a slice
the old man died
welcome my son
welcome to the machine
where have you been
it's all right we know where you've been
you've been in the pipe line filling in time
provided with toys and scouting for boys
you bought a guitar to punish you ma
you didn't like school
and you know you're nobody's fool
so welcome to the machine
welcome my son
welcome to the machine
what did you dream
it's all right we told you what to dream
you dreamed of a big star
he played a mean guitar
he always ate in the steak bar
he loved to drive in his jaguar
so welcome to the machine
cut
in the year of assembled here the volunteers
in the days when the lands were few
here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
the sweetest sight ever seen
and the night followed day and the story tellers say
that the score brave souls inside
for many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
ne'er looked back never feared never cried

one day in the year of the fox
came a time remembered well
when the strong young man
of the rising sun heard the
tolling of the great black bell
one day in the year of the fox when the
bell began to ring it meant the
time had come for the one to go to the
temple of the king
there in the middle of the circle he stands
searching seeking
with just one touch of his trembling hand
the answer will be found
daylight waits while the old man sings
heaven help me
just like a rush of thousand wings
it shines upon the one
and the day has just begun
one day in the year of the fox
came a time remembered well
when the strong young man
of the rising sun heard the
tolling of the great black bell
one day in the year of the fox when the
bell began to sing it meant the
time had come for the one to go to the
temple of the king
there in the middle of people he stands
seeing feeling
just a wave of the strong right hand
he's gone to the
temple of the king
e||
e||
e||
far from the circle of the edge of the world
he's hoping wondering
thinking back of the stories he's heard
what he's going to see
there in the middle of the circle he lies
heaven help me
all could see by the shine in his eyes
the answer has been found
back with the people in the circle he stands
giving feeling
with just one touch of the strong right hand they know
of the temple and the king

strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly
with his song
oooo ooo oooo ooo oooo ooo
i heard he sang a good song
i heard he had a style
and so i came to see him
to listen for a while
and there he was this young boy
a stranger to my eyes
strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly
with his song
i felt all flushed with fever
embarrassed by the crowd
i felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud
i prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on
strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly
with his song
he sang as if he knew me
in all my dark despair
and then he looked right through me
as if i wasn't there
and he just kept on singing
singing clear and strong
strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly
with his song
ooooh oh ohhh
oh ohhh oh oh ohhh

i can tell by your eyes
that you've probably been crying forever
and the stars in the sky don't mean nothing
to you they're a mirror
i don't wanna talk about it how you broke my heart
if i stay here just a little bit longer
if i stay here won't you listen
to my heart oh my heart
if i stand all alone
will the shadows hide the colours of my heart
the stars in the sky don't mean nothing
to you they're a mirror
i don't wanna talk about it how you broke my heart
if i stay here just a little bit longer
if i stay here won't you listen
to my heart oh my heart
i don't wanna talk about it how you broke my heart
if i stay here just a little bit longer
if i stay here won't you listen
to my heart oh my heart
wake up maggie i think i got something to say to you
it's late september and i really should be back at school
i know i keep you amused but i feel i'm being used
oh maggie i couldn't have tried any more
you lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
you stole my heart and that's what really hurts
the morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
but that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
i laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax
oh maggie i couldn't have tried any more
you lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
you stole my soul that's a pain i can do without
all i need was a friend to lend a guiding hand
but you turned into a lover and mother what a lover your wore me out
all you did was wreck my bed and in the morning kick me in the head
oh maggie i couldn't have tried any more
you lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
you stole my heart i couldn't leave you if i tried
i suppose i could collect my books and get back to school
or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand
oh maggie i wish i'd never seen your face
you made a first class fool out of me
but i'm as blind as a fool can be
you stole my heart but i love you anyway
i am sailing i am sailing home again 'cross the sea
i am sailing stormy waters to be near you to be free
i am flying i am flying like a bird 'cross the sky
i am flying passing high clouds to be near you to be free
can you hear me can you hear me thru the dark night far away
i am dying forever trying to be with you who can say
can you hear me can you hear me thru the dark night far away
i am dying forever trying to be with you who can say
we are sailing we are sailing home again 'cross the sea
we are sailing stormy waters to be near you to be free
oh lord to be near you to be free
oh lord to be near you to be free
repeat all

i would have given you all of my heart

the first cut is the deepest
baby i know
the first cut is the deepest

robin hood and little john
walkin' through the forest
at what the other'ne has to say
havin' such a good time
golly what a day
never ever thinkin' there was danger in the water
they were drinkin' they just guzzled it down
never dreamin' that a schemin' sherrif and his posse
was awatchin' them an' gatherin' around
robin hood and little john
runnin' through the forest
an' tryin' to get away
but escape an' fin'lly makin' it
golly what a day
oodelally oodelally
golly what a day
by yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes
where the sun shines bright on loch lomond
there me and my true love spent many happy days
on the bonnie bonnie banks o' loch lomond
oh ye'll tak' the high road and i'll tak' the low road
and i'll be in scotland before ye
but me and my true love will never meet again
on the bonnie bonnie banks o' loch lomond
'twas there that we parted in yon shady glen
on the steep steep side o' ben lomon'
where in purple hue the hieland hills we view
an' the moon comin' out in the gloamin'
oh ye'll tak' the high road and i'll tak' the low road
and i'll be in scotland before ye
but me and my true love will never meet again
on the bonnie bonnie banks o' loch lomond
the wee birdies sing and the wild flow'rs spring
and in sunshine the waters are sleepin'
but the broken heart it kens nae second spring
tho' the waefu' may cease frae their greetin'
oh ye'll tak' the high road and i'll tak' the low road
and i'll be in scotland before ye
but me and my true love will never meet again
on the bonnie bonnie banks o' loch lomond
on the bonnie bonnie banks
on the bonnie bonnie banks
on the bonnie bonnie banks
on the bonnie bonnie banks
on the bonnie bonnie banks
i was tired of my lady
we'd been together too long
like a worn out recording
of a favorite song
so while she lay there sleepin'
i read the paper in bed
and in the personal columns
there was this letter i read
if you like piña coladas
and gettin' caught in the rain
if you're not into yoga
if you have half a brain
if you like makin' love at midnight
in the dunes of a cape
then i'm the love that you've looked for
write to me and escape
i didn't think about my lady
i know that sounds kind of mean
but me and my old lady
had fallen into the same old dull routine
so i wrote to the paper
took out a personal ad
and though i'm nobody's poet
i thought it wasn't half bad
yes i like piña coladas
and getting caught in the rain
i'm not much into health food
i am into champagne
i've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
and cut through all this red tape
at a bar called o'malley's
where we'll plan our escape
so i waited with high hopes
and she walked in the place
i knew her smile in an instant
i knew the curve of her face
it was my own lovely lady
and she said
i got a black magic woman i got a black magic woman
i got a black magic woman got me so blind i can't see
that she's a black magic woman she's tryin' to make a devil out of me
don't turn your back on me baby don't turn your back on me baby
yes don't turn your back on me baby stop messin' around with your tricks
don't turn your back on me baby you just might pick up my magic sticks
got your spell on me baby got your spell on me baby
got your spell on me baby turnin' my heart into stone
i need you so bad magic woman i can't leave you alone

arrive at seven the place feels good
no time to call you today
encores till eleven then chinese food
back to the hotel again
i call your number the line ain't free
i'd like to tell you come to me
a night without you seems like a lost dream
love i can't tell you how i feel
always somewhere miss you where i've been
i'll be back to love you again
always somewhere miss you where i've been
i'll be back to love you again
another morning another place
the only day off is far away
but every city has seen me in the end
and brings me to you again
always somewhere miss you where i've been
i'll be back to love you again
always somewhere miss you where i've been
i'll be back to love you again

he gives the world its saddest sound
it's saddest sound
i'd rather be a hammer than a nail
yes i would if i only could i surely would
away i'd rather sail away
like a swan that's here and gone
a man gets tied up to the ground
he gives the world its saddest sound
it's saddest sound
i'd rather be a forest than a street
yes i would if i could i surely would
away i'd rather sail away
like a swan that's here and gone
a man gets tied up to the ground
he gives the world its saddest sound
it's saddest sound
i'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
yes i would if i only could i surely would
away i'd rather sail away
like a swan that's here and gone
a man gets tied up to the ground
he gives the world its saddest sound

tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
parsley sage rosemary and thyme
and gather it all in a bunch of heather
then she'll be a true love of mine

parsley sage rosemary and thyme
remember me to one who lives there

making one as lovely as she

without you who conceived the one

strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
and words from our hearts
told only to the wind felt even without being said
i don't want to bore you with my trouble

of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find

that makes me weak and knocks me off my feet

music is a world within itself
with a language we all understand
with an equal opportunity
for all to sing dance and clap their hands
but just because a record has a groove
don't make it in the groove
but you can tell right away at letter a
when the people start to move
they can feel it all over they can feel it all over people
they can feel it all over they can feel it all over people




music knows it is and always will
be one of the things that life just won't quit
but here are some of music's pioneers
that time will not allow us to forget
for there's basie miller satchmo
and the king of all sir duke
and with a voice like ella's ringing out
there's no way the band can lose
you can feel it all over you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over you can feel it all over people




you can feel it all over you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over you can feel it all over people
you can feel it all over i can feel it all over all over now people
they can feel it all over come on let's feel it all over people
you can feel it all over everybody all over people







very superstitious writing's on the wall
when you believe in things

because you came to my rescue
and i know that this must be heaven

when i was young it seemed that life was so wonderful
a miracle oh it was beautiful magical
and all the birds in the trees well they'd be singing so happily
joyfully playfully watching me
but then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible
logical responsible practical
and they showed me a world where i could be so dependable
clinical intellectual cynical
there are times when all the world's asleep
the questions run too deep
for such a simple man
won't you please please tell me what we've learned
i know it sounds absurd
but please tell me who i am
now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
liberal fanatical criminal
won't you sign up your name we'd like to feel you're acceptable
respectable presentable a vegetable
at night when all the world's asleep
the questions run so deep
for such a simple man
won't you please please tell me what we've learned
i know it sounds absurd
but please tell me who i am
who i am
who i am

the gypsy flies from coast to coast
knowing many loving none
bearing sorrow havin' fun
but back home he'll always run to sweet melissa mmm
freight train each car looks the same all the same
and no one knows the gypsy's name
no one hears his lonely sigh
there are no blankets where he lies
in all his deepest dreams the gypsy flies with sweet melissa mmm
again the morning's come
again he's on the run
sunbeams shining through his hair
appearing not to have a care
well pick up your gear and gypsy roll on roll on
crossroads will you ever let him go lord lord
will you hide the dead man's ghost
or will he lie beneath the clay
or will his spirit roll away
but i know that he won't stay without melissa

in a dream i heard a voice saying "fear not come rejoice
it's the end of the beginning praise the new born king"
how a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
son of a carpenter mary carried the light
this must be christmas must be tonight
i saw it with my own eyes written up in the skies
but why a simple herdsmen such as i
and then it came to pass he was born at last
right below the star that shines on high

son of a carpenter mary carried the light
this must be christmas must be tonight

words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
they slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
possessing and caressing me

when i find myself in times of trouble mother mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom let it be
and in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
speaking words of wisdom let it be
let it be let it be let it be let it be
and when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
there will be an answer let it be
for though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
there will be an answer let it be
let it be let it be let it be let it be
let it be let it be let it be let it be

let it be let it be let it be let it be
and when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
shine until tomorrow let it be
i wake up to the sound of music mother mary comes to me

the long and winding road
that leads to your door
will never disappear

many times i've been alone and
many times i've cried
anyway you'll never know the
many ways i've tried
and still they lead me back to the long and winding road
you left me standing here a long long long time ago
don't leave me waiting here lead me to your door
but still they lead me back to the long and winding road
you left me standing here a long long time ago
don't keep me waiting here lead me to your door

when i was small i believed in santa claus
'though i knew it was my dad
and i would hang up my stocking at christmas
open my presents and i'd be glad
but the last time i played father christmas
i stood outside a department store
a gang of kids came over and mugged me
they knocked my reindeer to the floor
and said father christmas give us some money

we'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
we want your bread so don't make us annoyed
give all the toys
to the little rich boys

don't give my sister a cuddly toy
we don't want a jigsaw or monopoly money
we only want the real mccoy
father christmas give us the money
we'll beat you up if you make us annoyed
father christmas give us some money
don't mess around with those silly toys
but give my daddy a job 'cos he needs one
he's got lots of mouths to feed
and if you've got one i'll have a machine gun
so i can scare all the kids on the street
father christmas give us some money
we've got no time for your silly toys
we'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
we want your bread so don't make us annoyed
give all the toys
to the little rich boys
father christmas give us some money

where you drink champagne and it tastes just like coca cola
cola cola
she walked up to me and she asked me to dance
i asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said lola
lola lola lo lo lo lo lola
well i'm not the worlds most physical guy
but when she squeezed me tight
she nearly broke my spine oh my lola

why she walked like a woman and talked like a man
oh my lola
lo lo lo lo lola lo lo lo lo lola
well we drank champagne and danced all night
under electric candlelight
she picked me up and sat me on her knee
well i'm not the world's most passionate guy
but when i looked in her eye well i almost fell for my lola
lo lo lo lo lola lo lo lo lo lola
lola lo lo lo lo lola lo lo lo lo lola
i pushed her away
i walked to the door
i fell to the floor
i got down on my knees
then i looked at her and she at me
well that's the way that i want it to stay
and i always want it to be that way for my lola
lo lo lo lo lola
girls will be boys and boys will be girls
it's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for lola

this love of life makes me weak in my knees
and when we get there make your play
cos soon i feel you're gonna carry us away
in a promised lie you made us believe

out here in the fields
i fight for my meals
i get my back into my living
i don't need to fight
to prove i'm right
i don't need to be forgiven yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
don't cry
don't raise your eye
it's only teenage wasteland
sally take my hand
we'll travel south cross land
put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
the exodus is here
the happy ones are near
let's get together before we get much older
teenage wasteland
it's only teenage wasteland
teenage wasteland oh yeah
teenage wasteland
they're all wasted
no one knows what it's like
to be the bad man
to be the sad man
behind blue eyes
no one knows what it's like
to be hated
to be fated
to telling only lies
but my dreams
they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours only lonely
my love is vengeance
thats never free
no one knows what it's like
to feel these feelings
like i do
and i blame you
no one bites back as hard
on their anger
none of my pain and woe
can show through
but my dreams
they aren't as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours only lonely
my love is vengeance
that's never free
when my fist clenches crack it open
before i use it and lose my cool
when i smile tell me some bad news
before i laugh and act like a fool
and if i swallow anything evil
put your finger down my throat
and if i shiver please give me a blanket
keep me warm let me wear your coat
no one knows what it's like
to be the bad man
to be the sad man
behind blue eyes
i was born on a dublin street where the royal drums do beat
and the loving english feet they walked all over us
and every single night when me da would come home tight
he'd invite the neighbors outside with this chorus
oh come out you black and tans
come out and fight me like a man
show your wife how you won medals down in flanders
tell them how the ira made you run like hell away
from the green and lovely lanes in killashandra
come let me hear you tell
how you slandered great parnell
when you thought him well and truly persecuted
where are the sneers and jeers
that you loudly let us hear
when our heroes of sixteen were executed
oh come out you black and tans
come out and fight me like a man
show your wife how you won medals down in flanders
tell them how the ira made you run like hell away
from the green and lovely lanes in killashandra
come tell us how you slew
those ol' arabs two by two
like the zulus they had spears and bows and arrows
how you bravely faced one
with your sixteen pounder gun
and you frightened them poor natives to their marrow
oh come out you black and tans
come out and fight me like a man
show your wife how you won medals down in flanders
tell them how the ira made you run like hell away
from the green and lovely lanes in killashandra
now the time is coming fast
and i think them days are here
when each english yeoman he will run before us
and if there be a need
then our kids will say "godspeed"
with a verse or two of singing this fine chorus
oh come out you black and tans
come out and fight me like a man
show your wife how you won medals down in flanders
tell them how the ira made you run like hell away
from the green and lovely lanes in killashandra
guess who just got back today
them wild eyed boys that had been away

well this chick got up and she slapped johnny's face

long afloat on shipless oceans
i did all my best to smile
'til your singing eyes and fingers
drew me loving to your isle
and you sang "sail to me
sail to me let me unfold you"
here i am here i am waiting to hold you
did i dream you dreamed about me
were you hare when i was fox
now my foolish boat is leaning
broken lovelorn on your rocks
for you sing "touch me not
touch me not come back tomorrow"
oh my heart oh my heart shies from the sorrow
i'm as puzzled as the oyster
i'm as troubled as the tide
should i stand amid the breakers
or should i lie with death my bride
hear me sing "swim to me
swim to me let me enfold you"
oh my heart oh my heart is waiting to hold you
hello it's me
i've thought about us for a long long time
maybe i think too much but something's wrong
there's something here that doesn't last too long
maybe i shouldn't think of you as mine
seeing you
or seeing anything as much as i do you
i take for granted that you're always there
i take for granted that you just don't care
sometimes i can't help seeing all the way through
it's important to me
that you know you are free
'cause i never want to make you change for meeee ee
think of me
you know that i'd be with you if i could
i'll come around to see you once in a while
or if i ever need a reason to smile
and spend the night if you think i should
it's important to me
that you know you are free
'cause i never want to make you change for meeee ee
think of me
you ououou know that i'd be with you if i could
i'll come around to see you once in a while
or if i ever need a reason to smile

well she was an american girl
raised on promises
she couldn't help thinkin' that there was a
little more to life somewhere else
after all it was a great big world
with lots of places to run to
and if she had to die tryin' she had one little promise she was gonna keep
o yeah all right take it easy baby make it last all night
she was an american girl
well it was kinda cold that night
she stood alone on the balcony
yeah she could hear the cars roll by
out on like waves crashin' on the beach
and for one desperate moment there
he crept back in her memory
god it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach
o yeah all right take it easy baby make it last all night
she was an american girl
repeat to end
hey charlie i'm pregnant
and living on the street
right above a dirty bookstore
off euclid avenue
and i stopped takin' dope
and i quit drinkin' whiskey
and my old man plays the trombone
and works out at the track
and he says that he loves me
even though it's not his baby
and he says that he'll raise him up
like he would his own son
and he gave me a ring
that was worn by his mother
and he takes me out dancin'
every saturday night
and hey charlie i think about you
every time i pass a fillin' station
on account of all the grease
you used to wear in your hair
and i still have that record
of little anthony the imperials
but someone stole my record player
now how do you like that
hey charlie i almost went crazy
after mario got busted
so i went back to omaha to
live with my folks
but everyone i used to know
was either dead or in prison
so i came back to minneapolis
this time i think i'm gonna stay
hey charlie i think i'm happy
for the first time since my accident
and i wish i had all the money
that we used to spend on dope
i'd buy me a used car lot
and i wouldn't sell any of em
i'd just drive a different car
every day dependin' on how i feel
hey charlie for chrissakes
do you want to know the truth of it
i don't have a husband
he don't play the trombone
and i need to borrow money
to pay this lawyer
charlie hey
i'll be eligible for parole
come valentine's day

well i hope that i don't fall in love with you
'cause falling in love jus' makes me blue
well the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
i had a beer and now i hear you callin' out to me
and i hope that don't fall in love with you
well the room is crowded there's people everywhere
and i wonder should i offer you a chair
well if you sit down with this ol' clown i'll take that frown and break it
before the evening's gone away i think that we could make it
and i hope that i don't fall in love with you
well the night does funny things inside a man
these old tomcat feelings you don't understand
when i turn around to look at you you light cigarette
i wish i had the guts to bum one but we've never met
and i hope that i don't fall in love with you
i can see that you are lonesome just like me
and it being late you'd like some company
well i turn around to look at you and you look back at me
the guy you're with has up and split the chair next to you's free
and i hope the you don't fall in love with me
now it's closing time the music's fading out
last call for drinks i'll have another stout
when i turn around to look at you you're nowhere to be found
i search the place for your lost face guess i'll have another round
and i think that i just fell in love with you
well my time went so quickly i went licketysplitly
out to my ol’ fiftyfive
as i pulled away slowly feelin' so holy
god knows i was feelin’ alive
and now the sun's comin' up
i'm ridin' with lady luck
freeway cars and trucks
stars beginning to fade
and i lead the parade
just awishin' i'd stayed a little longer
oh lord let me tell you that the feelin's gettin' stronger
and at six in the mornin' gave me no warnin'
i had to be on my way
well there’s trucks all apassin' me and the lights all aflashin'

and now the sun's comin' up

freeway cars and trucks
stars beginning to fade
and i lead the parade
just awishin' i'd stayed a little longer
oh lord let me tell you that the feelin's gettin' stronger
well my time went so quickly i went licketysplitly
out to my ol’ fiftyfive
as i pulled away slowly feelin' so holy

there's a place for us
somewhere a place for us
peace and quiet and open air
wait for us somewhere
there's a time for us
someday a time for us
time together with time to spare
time to learn time to care
someday somewhere
we'll find a new way of living
we'll find a way of forgiving somewhere
there's a place for us
a time and place for us
hold my hand and we're halfway there
hold my hand and i'll take you there
somehow someday somewhere
e|| e||
it's not in the way that you hold me
it's not in the way you say you care
it's not in the way you've been treating my friends
it's not in the way that you stayed till the end
it's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do
hold the line love isn't always on time oh oh oh
it's not in the words that you told me girl
it's not in the way you say you're mine ooh
it's not in the way that you came back to me
it's not in the way that your love set me free
it's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do
hold the line love isn't always on time oh oh oh
she came to me one morning one lonely sunday morning
her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind
i know not how she found me for in darkness i was walking
and destruction lay around me from a fight i could not win
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
she asked me name my foe then i said the need within some men
to fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or god
and i begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies
so eager was my passion to devour this waste of life
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
but she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals
so easy to begin and yet impossible to end
for she's the mother of our men who counselled me so wisely then
i feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
oh lady lend your hand outright and let me rest here at your side
have faith and trust in peace she said and filled my heart with life
there is no strength in numbers have no such misconception
but when you need me be assured i won't be far away
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
thus having spoke she turned away and though i found no words to say
i stood and watched until i saw her black coat disappear
my labour is no easier but now i know i'm not alone
i find new heart each time i think upon that windy day
and if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise
take courage from her as your prize and say hello from me
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
ah ahah ahahah ahahah
ah ahahah ahahah
i can feel her heartbeat from a thousand miles
and the heavens open every time she smiles
and when i come to her that's where i belong
yeah i'm running to her like a river's song
she gives me love love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love love crazy love
she's got a fine sense of humor when i'm feeling low down
and when i come to her when the sun goes down
she take away my trouble take away my grief
take away my heartache in the night like a thief
she gives me love love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love love crazy love
yeh i need her in the daytime yeh i need her in the night
and i want to throw my arms around her kiss and hug her kiss and hug her tight
and when i'm returning from so far away
she gives me some sweet lovin brightens up my day
yeh it makes me righteous yes it makes me whole
yeh it makes me mellow down into my soul
she gives me love love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love love crazy love

cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
they'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold
lonestar belt buckles and old faded levi's and each night begins a new day
if you don't understand him and he don't die young
he'll probably just ride away
mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
they'll never stay home and they're always alone
even with someone they love
cowboys like smokey ol' pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
them that don't know him won't like him and them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
he ain't wrong he's just different but his pride won't let him
do the things to make you think he's right
mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
they'll never stay home and they're always alone
even with someone they love
maybe i didn't love you
quite as often as i could have
maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should have
if i made you feel second best
girl i'm sorry i was blind
but you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely lonely times
i guess i never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine
little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time
but you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
tell me
tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
give me
give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
i'll keep you satisfied
e|||
e|||
little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time
but you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
in the twilight glow i see her
blue eyes cryin' in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we'd never meet again
love is like a dying ember
only memories remain
and through the ages i'll remember
blue eyes crying in the rain
someday when we meet up yonder
we'll stroll hand in hand again
in the land that knows no parting
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
on the road again just can't wait to get on the road again
the life i love is makin' music with my friends
and i can't wait to get on the road again
on the road again going places that i've never been
seein' things that i may never see again
and i can't wait to get on the road again
on the road again like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
we're the best of friends insisting that the world keep turnin' our way and our way
is on the road again just can't wait to get on the road again
the life i love is makin' music with my friends
and i can't wait to get on the road again
on the road again like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
we're the best of friends insisting that the world keep turnin' our way and our way
is on the road again just can't wait to get on the road again
the life i love is makin' music with my friends
and i can't wait to get on the road again and i can't wait to get on the road again
he looked down into her brown eyes and said say a prayer for me
she threw her arms around him whispered god will keep us free
they could see the riders coming he said this is my last fight
if they take me back to texas they won't take me back alive
they were praying for the lovers in the valley of the gun
when the battle stopped and the smoke cleared there was thunder from the throne
and seven spanish angels took another angel home
she reached down and picked the gun up that lay smoking in his hand
she said father please forgive me i can't make it without my man
and she knew the gun was empty and she knew she could not win
but her final prayer was answered when the rifles fired again
they were praying for the lovers in the valley of the gun
when the battle stopped and the smoke cleared there was thunder from the throne
and seven spanish angels took another angel home
they came and found the lovers as they lay there side by side
their dreams had all been shattered they said she was his bride
and they laid them by the altar in the valley of the gun
now their final fight was over and their battle had been won
they were praying for the lovers in the valley of the gun
when the battle stopped and the smoke cleared there was thunder from the throne
and seven spanish angels took another angel home

i'll be the roundabout
the words will make you out 'n' out
i spend the day your way
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley
the music dance and sing
they make the children really ring
i spend the day your way
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley
in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky and they
stand there
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
twenty four before my love you'll see i'll be there with you
i will remember you
your silhouette will charge the view
of distance atmosphere
call it morning driving through the sound and
even in the valley
in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky and they
stand there
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
twenty four before my love you'll see i'll be there with you

along the drifting cloud
the eagle searching down on the land
catching the swirling wind
the sailor sees the rim of the land
the eagle's dancing wings
create as weather spins out of hand
go closer hold the land
feel partly no more than grains of sand
we stand to lose all time
a thousand answers by in our hand
next to your deeper fears
we stand surrounded by a million years
i'll be the roundabout
the words will make you out 'n' out
i'll be the roundabout
the words will make you out 'n' out
in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
twenty four before my love and i'll be there
i'll be the roundabout
the words will make you out 'n' out
i spend the day your way
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley
in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
twenty four before my love you'll see i'll be there with you
da la la la da da la

rumors spreadin' 'round in that texas town
'bout that shack outside la grange
and you know what i'm talkin' about
