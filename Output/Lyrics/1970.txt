i wanna talk
about things gone
though hurting
now history
i've played cards
and done
nothing say
no ace play
the winner takes
the loser standing small
beside victory
that's destiny
i arms
thinking i belonged
i figured made sense
building fence
building home
thinking i'd strong
but i fool
playing rules
the gods may throw dice
their minds cold ice
and someone way
loses someone dear
the winner takes
the loser fall
it's simple plain
why i complain
but tell kiss
like i used kiss
does feel
when calls name
somewhere deep inside
you must know i miss
but i say
rules must obeyed
the judges will decide
the likes abide
spectators show
always staying low
the game
a lover friend
a big thing small
the winner takes
i wanna talk
if makes feel sad
and i understand
you've come shake hand
i apologize
if makes feel bad
seeing tense
no selfconfidence see …z
the winner takes
the winner takes
so winner takes
and loser fall
throw diice cold ice
way someone dear
takes aall fall
it seems plain

my waterloo napoleon surrender
oh yeah i met destiny quite similar way
the history book shelf
is always repeating
waterloo i defeated won war
waterloo promise love
waterloo couldn't escape i wanted
waterloo knowing fate
wowowo wowo waterloo finally facing waterloo
my i tried hold back stronger
oh yeah now seems chance giving fight
and i refuse

waterloo i defeated won war
waterloo promise love
waterloo couldn't escape i wanted
waterloo knowing fate
wowowo wowo waterloo finally facing waterloo so
so i refuse
i feel i win i lose
waterloo couldn't escape i wanted
waterloo knowing fate
wowowo wowo waterloo finally facing waterloo ooohoohoohooh

that drowns tender reed
some say love razor
that leaves soul bleed
some say love hunger
an endless aching need
i say love flower
you seed
it's heart afraid breaking
that never learns dance
it's dream afraid waking
that never takes chance
it's one taken
who seem give
and soul afraid dying
that never learns live
when night lonely
and road long
and think love
for lucky strong
just remember winter
far beneath bitter snow
lies seed sun's love
in spring becomes rose

oo oo oo oo
your breath sweet eyes
two jewels sky
your back straight hair smooth
on pillow lie
but i sense affection
no gratitude love
your loyalty stars
one cup coffee road
one cup coffee 'fore i go
to valley
your daddy outlaw
and wanderer trade
he'll teach pick choose
and throw blade
and oversees kingdom
so stranger intrude
his voice trembles calls
for another plate food
one cup coffee road
one cup coffee 'fore i go
to valley
your sister sees future
like momma
you've never learned read write
there's books upon shelf
and pleasure knows limits
your voice meadow larks
but heart ocean
mysterious dark
one cup coffee road
one cup coffee 'fore i go
to valley
'twas another lifetime one toil blood
when blackness virtue the road full mud
i came wilderness a creature void form
come said i'll give ya shelter storm
and i pass way you rest assured
i'll always best on i give word
in world steeleyed death men who fighting warm
come said i'll give ya shelter storm
not word spoke us there little risk involved
everything point had left unresolved
try imagining place where always safe warm
come said i'll give ya shelter storm
i burned exhaustion buried hail
poisoned bushes and blown trail
hunted crocodile ravaged corn
come said i'll give ya shelter storm
suddenly i turned around and standing
with silver bracelets wrists and flowers hair
she walked gracefully and took crown thorns
come said i'll give ya shelter storm
now wall us somethin' lost
i took much granted got signals crossed
just think began long forgotten morn
come said i'll give shelter storm
well deputy walks hard nails preacher rides mount
but nothing really matters much doom alone counts
and oneeyed undertaker blows futile horn
come said i'll give shelter storm
i've heard newborn babies wailin' mournin' dove
and old men broken teeth stranded without love
do i understand question hopeless forlorn
come said i'll give shelter storm
in little hilltop village gambled clothes
i bargained salvation gave lethal dose
i offered innocence got repaid scorn
come said i'll give shelter storm
well i'm livin' foreign country i'm bound cross line
beauty walks razor's edge someday i'll make mine
if i turn back clock god born
come said i'll give shelter storm
they sat together park evening sky grew dark
she looked felt spark tingle bones
it felt alone wished gone straight
and watched simple twist fate
they walked along old canal little confused i remember well
and stopped strange hotel neon burning bright
he felt heat night hit freight train
moving simple twist fate
a saxophone someplace far played walking arcade
as light bust beatup shade waking
she dropped coin cup blind man gate
and forgot simple twist fate
lyrics harmonica solo
lyrics harmonica solo
he woke room bare see anywhere
he told care pushed window open wide
felt emptiness inside relate
brought simple twist fate
he hears ticking clocks walks along parrot talks
hunts waterfront docks sailors come
maybe pick long must wait
one time simple twist fate
people tell sin know feel much within
i still believe twin i lost ring
she born spring i born late
blame simple twist fate
lyrics harmonica solo
lyrics harmonica solo
early one mornin' sun shinin'
i layin' bed
wond'rin' changed
if hair still red
her folks said lives together
sure gonna rough
they never mama's homemade dress
papa's bankbook big enough
and i standin' side road
rain fallin' shoes
heading east coast
lord knows i've paid dues gettin'
tangled blue
she married first met
soon divorced
i helped jam i guess
but i used little much force
we drove car far
abandoned west
split dark sad night
both agreeing best
she turned around look
as i walkin' away
i heard say shoulder
"we'll meet someday avenue"
tangled blue
i job great north woods
working cook spell
but i never much
and one day ax fell
so i drifted new orleans
where i happened employed
workin' fishin' boat
right outside delacroix
but i alone
the past close behind
i seen lot women
but never escaped mind i grew
tangled blue
she workin' topless place
and i stopped beer
i kept lookin' side face
in spotlight clear
and later crowd thinned
i's
she standing back chair
said "don't i know name"
i muttered somethin' underneath breath
she studied lines face
i must admit i felt little uneasy
when bent tie laces shoe
tangled blue
she lit burner stove
offered pipe
"i thought never say hello" said
"you look silent type"
then opened book poems
and handed
written italian poet
from thirteenth century
and every one words rang true
and glowed burnin' coal
pourin' every page
like written soul
tangled blue
i lived montague street
in basement stairs
there music cafes night
and revolution air
then started dealing slaves
and something inside died
she sell everything owned
and froze inside
and finally bottom fell
i became withdrawn
the thing i knew
was keep keepin' bird flew
tangled blue
so now i'm goin' back
i got somehow
all people used know
they're illusion now

and compensation little ask

to man
storm clouds raging around door
i think i might take
take woman kind
to find man
but oh wonderful feeling

when riding sixteen hours nothing much
and feel much riding wish trip

and feel eyes upon shaking cold
you pretend bother want explode
most times hear 'em talk times
all old clichés "is woman man"
and always seem outnumbered dare make stand
here i road

here i go playing star
there i go turn page ah
out spotlight million miles away
every ounce energy try give away
as sweat pours body music play

still rain kept pourin'
fallin' ears
and i wonder still i wonder
who'll stop rain

yellow moon rise
big birds flying across sky
throwing shadows eyes

big birds flying across sky
throwing shadows eyes
helpless helpless helpless

for hours hours
while i listen play love songs
all night long
only

and rest head five minutes

you road
must code live
and become
because past goodbye
teach children well
their father's hell slowly go
and feed dreams
the one picked's one know
don't ask told will cry
so look sigh
know love
and tender years
can't know fears elders grew
and please help youth
they seek truth die
teach parents well
their children's hell will slowly go
and feed dreams
the one picked's one know
don't ask told will cry
so look sigh
know love
you ask i love and i choke reply
i'd rather hurt honestly than mislead lie
and i judge on say
i'm beginning see real
and sometimes touch the honesty's much
and i close eyes hide
i wanna hold til i die til break cry
i wanna hold till fear subsides
romance strategy leaves battling pride
but insecurity some tenderness survives
i'm another writer still trapped within truth
a hesitant prize fighter still trapped within youth
and sometimes touch the honesty's much
and i close eyes hide
i wanna hold til i die til break cry
i wanna hold till fear subsides
at times i'd break and drive knees
at times i'd break and hold endlessly
at times i understand and i know hard tried
i've watched love commands and i've watched love pass
at times i think drifters still searching friend
a brother sister but passion flares
and sometimes touch the honesty's much
and i close eyes hide
i wanna hold til i die til break cry
i wanna hold till fear subsides
oh yeah
still know i waiting
and time running wild
a million deadend streets
every time i thought i'd got made
it seemed taste sweet
so i turned face
but i've never caught glimpse
of others must see faker
i'm much fast take test
chchchchchanges
turn face strange
chchchanges
don't want richer man
chchchchchanges
turn face strange
chchchanges
it's gonna different man
time may change
but i trace time
i watch ripples change size
but never leave stream warm impermanence
and days float eyes
but still days seem
and children spit
as try change worlds
are immune consultations
they're quite aware going
chchchchchanges
turn face strange
chchchanges
don't want richer man
chchchchchanges
turn face strange
chchchanges
it's gonna different man
time may change
but trace time
strange fascination fascinating
changes taking pace i'm going
chchchchchanges
turn face strange
chchchanges
look rock'n'rollers
chchchchchanges
turn face strange
chchchanges
pretty soon now gonna older
time may change
but i trace time
i said time may change
but i trace time
pushing market square many mothers sighing

a girl age went head hit tiny children

a soldier broken arm fixed stare wheels cadillac
a cop knelt kissed feet priestand queer threw sight

smiling waving looking fine think you knew song
and cold rained i felt actor
and i thought ma i wanted back

echo distance
like sound
of windmill going round
guess i'll always
a soldier fortune

and i knew i chance
that i make people dance maybe happy
but february made shiver every paper i'd deliver
bad news doorstep i take one step
i remember i cried i read widowed bride
something touched deep inside
the day music died
so bye bye miss american pie

did write book love
and faith god bible tells
do believe rock roll
can music save mortal soul teach dance real slow
well i know love 'cuz i saw dancin' gym
you kicked shoes man i dig rhythm blues

but i knew i luck day music died i started singin'
bye bye miss american pie
drove chevy levy levy dry
and good old boys drinkin' whiskey rye
singin' will day i die will day i die
now ten years
moss grows fat rolling stone used
when jester sang king queen
coat borrowed james dean voice came
oh king looking jester stole thorny crown
the courtroom adjourned verdict returned
and lennin read book marx quartet practiced park
and sang dirges dark day music died singin'
bye bye miss american pie
drove chevy levy levy dry
and good old boys drinkin' whiskey rye
singin' will day i die will day i die
helter skelter summer swelter
birds flew fallout shelter eight miles high fallin' fast
it landed foul grass
players tried forward pass jester sidelines cast
now halftime air sweet perfume sergeants played marching tune
we got dance never got chance
'cuz players tried take field marching band refused yield
do recall revealed day music died started singin'
bye bye miss american pie
drove chevy levy levy dry
and good old boys drinkin' whiskey rye
singin' will day i die will day i die
and one place
generation lost space time left start
so come jack nimble jack quick jack flash sat candle
stick 'cuz fire devil's friend
and i watched stage hands clenched fists rage
no angel born hell break satan's spell
and flames climbed high night light sacrificial rite
i saw satan laughing delight day music died singin'
bye bye miss american pie
drove chevy levy levy dry
and good old boys drinkin' whiskey rye
singin' will day i die will day i die
i met girl sang blues
and i asked happy news smiled turned away
i went sacred store
where i'd heard music years man said music
play
but streets children screamed lovers cried poets dreamed
but word spoken church bells broken
and three men i admire father son holy ghost
they caught last train coast day music died
bye bye miss american pie
drove chevy levy levy dry
and good old boys drinkin' whiskey rye
singin' will day i die will day i die
they singin' bye bye miss american pie
drove chevy levy levy dry
and good old boys drinkin' whiskey rye
singin' will day i die
starry starry night
paint pallet blue grey
look summer's day eyes know darkness soul
shadows hills sketch trees daffodils
catch breeze winter chills colours snowy linen land
and now i understand tried say
how suffered sanity how tried set free
they listen know perhaps listen now
starry starry night
flaming flowers brightly blaze
swirling clouds violet haze reflect vincent's eyes china blue
colors changing hue morning fields amber grain
weathered faces lined pain soothed beneath artist's loving hand
and now i understand tried say
how suffered sanity how tried set free
they listen know perhaps listen now
for love still love true
and hope left sight starry starry night
you took life lovers often but i told vincent
this world never meant one beautiful
starry starry night
portraits hung empty halls
frameless heads nameless walls eyes watch world forget
like strangers met ragged men ragged clothes
the silver thorn bloody rose lie crushed broken virgin snow
and now i think i know tried say
how suffered sanity how tried set free
they listen listening still perhaps never will
i know see
the changes come
in last days i've afraid
that i might drift away
i've telling stories singing songs
that make think i come
that's reason i seem
so far away today
let tell i love
that i think time
caledonia calling
now i'm going home
but i become stranger
know make sad
caledonia's everything i've
now i moved kept moving
proved points i needed proving
lost friends i needed losing
found others way
i kissed ladies left crying
stolen dreams yes denying
i travelled hard sometimes conscience flying
somewhere wind
let tell i love
that i think time
caledonia calling
now i'm going home
but i become stranger
know make sad
caledonia's everything i've
now i'm sitting fire
the empty room forest choir
the flames higher
they've withered now gone
but i'm steady thinking way clear
and i know i will tomorrow
when hands shaken kisses flown
then i will disappear
let tell i love
that i think time
caledonia calling
now i'm going home
but i become stranger
know make sad
caledonia's everything i've
every night i'm lying bed holding close dreams
thinking things said coming apart seams
we try talk words come rough
i know trying give best love
beautiful faces loud empty places look way live
wasting time cheap talk wine left us little give
that old crowd cold dark cloud never rise
but heart i give best love
ohohoh ohhhh sweet darlin' best love
ohohoh ohhhh sweet darlin' best love
i'm going back time sweet dream
it quiet night i right i go sleeping
but every morning i wake worry gonna happen today
you see way i see mine see slipping away
you know always baby i guess enough ooohh
but heart i give best love
ohohoh ohhhh sweet darlin' best love
ohohoh ohhhh sweet darlin' best love

and made change name
and seems lived life
like candle wind
never knowing cling
when rain set
and i liked known

and pain price paid
even died
oh press still hounded

and seems lived life
like candle wind
never knowing cling
when rain set
and i liked known
but i kid
your candle burned long
your legend
goodbye norma jean
though i never knew
you grace hold
while around crawled
goodbye norma jean
from young man row
who sees something sexual
more marilyn monroe
and seems lived life
like candle wind
never knowing cling
when rain set
and i liked known
but i kid
your candle burned long
your legend
your candle burned long
your legend

when you get back on your feet again
everybody wants to be your long lost friend

santa lucia per tutti quelli che hanno gli occhi
e un cuore che non basta agli occhi
e per la tranquilla' di chi va per mare
e per ogni lacrima sul tuo vestito
per chi non ha capito
santa lucia per chi beve di notte
e di notte muore e di notte legge
e cade sul suo ultimo metro
e per gli amici che vanno e ritornano indietro
e hanno perduto l'anima e le ali
per chi vive all'incrocio dei venti ed e' bruciato vivo
per le persone facili che non hanno dubbi mai
per la nostra corona di stelle e di spine
e la nostra paura del buio e della fantasia
santa lucia il violino dei poveri
e' una barca sfondata e un ragazzino
al secondo piano che canta ride e stona
perche' vada lontano fa che gli sia dolce
anche la pioggia nelle scarpe anche la solitudine




petite marie je parle de toi
parce qu'avec ta petite voix
tes petites manies tu versé sur ma vie
des milliers de roses
petite furie je bats pour toi
pour que dans dix mille ans de ça
on se retrouve à l'abri sous un ciel aussi joli
que des milliers de roses
je viens du ciel et les étoiles entre elles
ne parlent que de toi
d'un musicien qui fait jouer ses mains
sur un morceau de bois
de leur amour plus bleu que le ciel autour
petite marie je t'attends transi
sous une tuile de ton toit
le vent de la nuit froide renvoie la ballade
que j'avais écrite pour toi
petite furie tu dis que la vie
c'est une bague à chaque doigt
au soleil de floride moi mes poches sont vides
et mes yeux pleurent de froid
je viens du ciel et les étoiles entre elles
ne parlent que de toi
d'un musicien qui fait jouer ses mains
sur un morceau de bois
de leur amour plus bleu que le ciel autour
dans la pénombre de ta rue
petite marie m'entendstu
je n'attends plus que toi pour partir
dans la pénombre de ta rue
petite marie m'entendstu
je n'attends plus que toi pour partir
je viens du ciel et les étoiles entre elles
ne parlent que de toi
d'un musicien qui fait jouer ses mains
sur un morceau de bois
de leur amour plus bleu que le ciel autour

which way will turn feeling love's concern
it's decides
noone around will carry blame
noone around will love today throw away
tomorrow rise another day realise
or send

but i see eyes
though i'm beside i carry lame
i may decide blessing i'll carry guessing
how high will leap will make enough reap
only arrive
at made end noone offended
it's decides

if i'm feeling less sour
i promise treat
and visit nearby tower
and climbing top

at church people saying
"my god tough stood
no point us remaining
we may well go home"
as i
alone naturally
to think yesterday
i cheerful bright gay
looking forward
the role i play
and knock
reality came around
and without much mere touch
threw little pieces
leaving doubt
talk god mercy
who he really exist
why he desert
in hour need

alone naturally
it seems hearts
broken world mended
left unattended

looking back years
and whatever appears

never wishing hide tears
and sixtyfive years old
my mother god rest soul
couldn't understand man
she loved taken
leaving start
with heart badly broken
despite encouragement
no words spoken
when passed away i cried cried day
alone naturally
fret top ewhilst still strumming time 'so long'
i've walking streets long
i know every crack dirty sidewalks broadway
where hustle name game
and nice guys washed away snow rain
there's load compromising
on road horizon
but i'm gonna lights shining
like rhinestone cowboy
riding horse star spangled rodeo
like rhinestone cowboy
getting cards letters people i even know
and offers coming phone
i really mind rain
you're taking train taking long way
and i dream things i'll
with subway token dollar tucked inside shoe
there'll load compromising
on road horizon
but i'm gonna lights shining
like rhinestone cowboy
riding horse star spangled rodeo
like rhinestone cowboy
getting cards letters people i even know
and offers coming phone
like rhinestone cowboy
riding horse star spangled rodeo
like rhinestone cowboy
getting cards letters people i even know
and offers coming phone

kept thinking i never live without side
but i spent many nights thinking wrong
and i grew strong i learned along

the legend lives chippewa
of big lake called "gitche gumee"
the lake said never gives dead
when skies november turn gloomy
with load iron ore twentysix thousand tons
than edmund fitzgerald weighed empty
that good ship crew bone chewed
when "gales november" came early
the ship pride american side
coming back mill wisconsin
as big freighters go bigger
with crew good captain well seasoned
concluding terms couple steel firms
when left fully loaded cleveland
and later night ship's bell rang
could north wind feelin'
the wind wires made tattletale sound
and wave broke railing
and every man knew captain
t'was witch november come stealin'
the dawn came late breakfast wait
when gales november came slashin'
when afternoon came freezin' rain
in face hurricane west wind
when suppertime came old cook came deck
sayin’ "fellas rough feed ya"
at seven pm main hatchway caved in'
said "fellas good t'know ya"
the captain wired water comin'
good ship crew peril
and later night 'is lights went outta sight
came wreck edmund fitzgerald
does one know love god goes
when waves turn minutes hours
the searches say made whitefish bay
if put fifteen miles behind
they might split might capsized
they may broke deep took water
and remains faces names
of wives sons daughters
lake huron rolls superior sings
in rooms icewater mansion
old michigan steams young man's dreams
the islands bays sportsmen
and farther lake ontario
takes lake erie send
and iron boats go mariners know
gales november remembered
in musty old hall detroit prayed
in "maritime sailors' cathedral"
the church bell chimed till rang twentynine times
for man edmund fitzgerald
the legend lives chippewa
of big lake call "gitche gumee"
"superior" said "never gives dead
when 'gales november' come early"

beer i breakfast bad
i one dessert
i fumbled closet clothes
found cleanest dirty shirt
i washed face combed hair
stumbled stairs meet day
i'd smoked mind night
cigarettes songs i'd picking
i lit first watched small kid playing
kicking
i walked across street
caught sunday smell someone's frying chicken
lord took back somethin i lost somewhere
somehow along way
sunday morning sidewalk
i'm wishing lord i stoned
cause something sunday
makes body feel alone
nothing short dying
half lonesome sound
sleeping city sidewalks
sunday morning coming
park i saw daddy
laughing little girl swinging
listened songs singing
i headed street
somewhere far away lonely bell ring ing
echoed canyons
disappearing dreams yester day
sunday morning sidewalk
i'm wishing lord i stoned
cause something sunday
makes body feel alone
nothing short dying
half lonesome sound
sleeping city sidewalks
sunday morning coming
the night dear i lay sleeping
i dreamed i held arms
when i awoke dear i mistaken
so i bowed head i cried
you sunshine sunshine
you make happy skies gray
you'll never know dear much i love
please take sunshine away
i always loved made happy
nothing come
now left love another
shattered dreams
you sunshine sunshine
you make happy skies gray
you'll never know dear much i love
please take sunshine away



toute la musique que j'aime
elle vient de là elle vient du blues
les mots ne sont jamais les mêmes
pour exprimer ce qu'est le blues
j'y mets mes joies j'y mets mes peines
et tout ça ça devient le blues
je le chante autant que je l'aime
et je le chanterai toujours
il y longtemps sur des guitares
des mains noires lui donnaient le jour
pour chanter les peines et les espoirs
pour chanter dieu et puis l'amour
la musique vivra tant que vivra le blues
le blues ça veut dire que je t'aime
et que j'ai mal à en crever
je pleure mais je chante quand même
c'est ma prière pour te garder
toute la musique que j'aime
elle vient de là elle vient du blues
les mots ne sont jamais les mêmes
pour exprimer ce qu'est le blues
j'y mets mes joies j'y mets mes peines
et tout ça ça devient le blues
je le chante autant que je l'aime
et je le chanterai toujours
il y longtemps sur des guitares
des mains noires lui donnaient le jour
pour chanter les peines et les espoirs
pour chanter dieu et puis l'amour
la musique vivra tant que vivra le blues
le blues ça veut dire que je t'aime
et que j'ai mal à en crever
je pleure mais je chante quand même
c'est ma prière pour te garder
toute la musique que j'aime
elle vient de là elle vient du blues
les mots les mots les mots ne sont jamais les mêmes
pour exprimer ce qu'est le blues
j'y mets mes joies j'y mets mes peines
et tout ça ça devient le blues
je le chante autant que je l'aime
et je le chanterai toujours
a ray hope flickers sky
a tiny star lights way high
all across land dawns brand new morn
this comes pass child born
a silent wish sails seven seas
the winds change whisper trees
and walls doubt crumble tossed torn
this comes pass child born
a rosy hue settles around
you've got feel solid ground
for spell two noone seems forlorn
this comes pass child born
it's dream illusion now
it must come true sometime soon somehow
all across land dawns brand new morn
this comes pass child born

i wish i river i skate away
i made baby cry
he tried hard help
you know put ease
and loved naughty
made weak knees

they're cutting trees
they're putting reindeer
and singing songs joy peace
oh i wish i river i skate away
repeat time played
once i rose noise confusion
just glimpse beyond illusion
i soaring higher
but i flew high
though eyes see i still blind man
though mind think i still mad man
i hear voices i'm dreaming
i hear say
carry wayward son
there'll peace done
lay weary head rest

masquerading man reason
my charade event season
and i claim wise man
it surely means i know
on stormy sea moving emotion
tossed i'm ship ocean
i set sail winds fortune
but i hear voices say
carry wayward son
there'll peace done
lay weary head rest
e|||||
carry
you will always remember
carry
nothing equals splendor
now life's longer empty
surely heaven waits
carry wayward son
there'll peace done
lay weary head rest
don't cry vocal echo don't cry
i close eyes
moment
moment's gone
dreams
pass eyes curiosity
dust wind
dust wind
same old song
drop water
endless sea

crumbles ground
though refuse see
dust wind
dust wind
now hang
nothing last forever
earth sky
slips way
and money
another minute buy
dust wind

joulumaahan matkamies jo moni tietä kysyy
sinne saattaa löytää vaikka paikallansa pysyy
katson taivaan tähtiä ja niiden helminauhaa
itsestäni etsittävä mun joulurauhaa
joulumaa muutakin kuin tunturi ja lunta
joulumaa ihmismielen rauhan valtakunta
eikä sinne matka silloin kovin kauan kestä
joulumaa jos jokaiselta löytyy sydämestä
joulumaasta kuvitellaan paljon kaikenlaista
kuinka toiveet toteutuu ja niin satumaista
voi jos jostain saada voisin suuren puurokauhan
sillä antaa tahtoisin mä maailmalle rauhan
joulumaa muutakin kuin pelkkää toiveunta
joulumaa ihmismielen rauhan valtakunta
eikä sinne matka silloin kovin kauan kestä
joulumaa jos jokaiselta löytyy sydämestä
joulumaasta uskoo moni onnen löytävänsä
mutta sepä kätkeytyy tai narraa etsijäänsä
onnea kun mikään mylly valmiiksi ei jauha
itsestään löydettävä ihmisen vain rauha
in bar toledo across depot
bar stool took ring
i thought i'd closer i walked
i sat asked name
quitter i finally quit livin' dreams
i'm hungry laughter i'm
whatever life brings
in mirror i saw i closely watched
i thought looked place
he came woman sat beside
strange look face
mountain minute i thought i dead
but started shaking big heart
breaking turned woman said
you picked fine time leave lucille
four hungry children crop field
i've bad times lived sad times
time hurting heal
you picked fine time leave lucille
after left us i ordered whisky i thought
made look small
from lights bar room rented hotel room
walked without talking
must thought i'd lost mind
i hold 'cos words told kept
coming back time time
you picked fine time leave lucille
four hungry children crop field
i've bad times lived sad times
time hurting heal
you picked fine time leave lucille
on warm summer's evenin' train bound nowhere
i met gambler tired sleep
so took turns starin' window darkness
'til boredom overtook us began speak
he said "son i've made life readin' people's faces
knowin' cards way held eyes
and mind sayin' i see aces
for taste whiskey i'll give advice"
so i handed bottle drank last swallow
then bummed cigarette asked light
and night got deathly quiet face lost expression
said "if gonna play game boy ya gotta learn play right
you got know hold 'em know fold 'em
know walk away know run
you never count money sittin' table
there'll time enough countin' dealin's done
ev'ry gambler knows secret survivin'
knowin' throw away knowing keep
'cause ev'ry hand's winner ev'ry hand's loser
best hope die sleep"
and finished speakin' turned back towards window
crushed cigarette faded sleep
and somewhere darkness gambler broke even
but final words i found ace i keep
you got know hold 'em know fold 'em
know walk away know run
you never count money sittin' table
there'll time enough countin' dealin's done
you got know hold 'em know fold 'em
know walk away know run
you never count money sittin' table
there'll time enough countin' dealin's done
you got know hold 'em know fold 'em
know walk away know run
you never count money sittin' table
there'll time enough countin' dealin's done

i'd lost somehow somewhere along way
on sunday mornin' sidewalks
wishing lord i stoned
'cause something sunday
makes body feel alone
and nothin' short dyin'
half lonesome sound
sleepin' city sidewalks
sunday mornin' comin'
in park i saw daddy
laughing little girl swingin'
listened song singin'
then i headed back home
somewhere far away lonely bell ringin'
echoed thru canyon
disappearing dreams yesterday
on sunday mornin' sidewalks
wishing lord i stoned
'cause something sunday
makes body feel alone
and nothin' short dyin'
half lonesome sound
sleepin' city sidewalks
sunday mornin' comin'

smoked stuff drank wine
made mind make new start
going california aching heart
someone told theres girl
with love eyes flowers hair
took chances big jet plane
never let tell theyre
the sea red sky grey
wondered tomorrow follow today
the mountains canyons started tremble shake
as children sun began awake
seems wrath gods
i think i might sinking
throw line i reach time
runs straight high
to find queen without king
they say plays guitar cries sings
ride white mare footsteps dawn
tryin find woman whos never never never born
standing hill mountain dreams
telling hard hard hard seems
oh let sun beat upon face stars fill dream
i traveler time space i
to sit elders gentle race world seldom seen
they talk days sit wait will revealed
talk song tongues lilting grace whose sounds caress ear
but word i heard i relate story quite clear
oh oh
oh i flying mama ain't denyin'
i've flying ain't denyin' denyin' vocal improv
all i see turns brown sun burns ground
and eyes fill sand i scan wasted land
trying find trying find i've
oh pilot storm leaves trace thoughts inside dream
heed path led place yellow desert stream
my shangrila beneath summer moon i will return
sure dust floats high june movin' kashmir
oh father four winds fill sails across sea years
with provision open face along straits fear

por la blanda arena
que lame el mar
no vuelve más
un sendero solo
de pena y silencio llegó
hasta el agua profunda
un sendero solo
de penas mudas llegó
hasta la espuma
sabe dios qué angustia
te acompañó
qué dolores viejos
calló tu voz
para recostarte
arrullada en el canto
de las caracolas marinas
la canción que canta
en el fondo oscuro del mar
la caracola
te vas alfonsina
con tu soledad
¿qué poemas nuevos
fuíste buscar
una voz antigüa
de viento y de sal
te requiebra el alma
y la está llevando
y te vas hacia allá
como en sueños
dormida alfonsina
vestida de mar
cinco sirenitas
te llevarán
por caminos de algas
y de coral
y fosforescentes
caballos marinos harán
una ronda tu lado
y los habitantes
del agua van jugar
pronto tu lado
bájame la lámpara
un poco más
déjame que duerma
nodriza en paz
y si llama él
no le digas que estoy
dile que alfonsina vuelve
y si llama él
no le digas nunca que estoy
di que ido
te vas alfonsina
con tu soledad
¿qué poemas nuevos
fuiste buscar
una voz antigüa
de viento y de sal
te requiebra el alma
y la está llevando
y te vas hacia allá
como en sueños
dormida alfonsina
vestida de mar

some things life bad really make mad
other things make swear curse
when chewing life's gristle
don't grumble give whistle

if life seems jolly rotten something forgotten
laugh smile dance sing
when feeling dumps silly chumps
just purse lips whistle thing
and always look bright side life
come always look bright side life
for life quite absurd death's final word
you must always face curtain bow
forget sin give audience grin
enjoy last chance anyhow
so always look bright side death
just draw terminal breath
life's piece shit look
life's laugh death's joke true
you'll see show
keep 'em laughing go
just remember last laugh
and always look bright side life
always look right side life

he came dancing across water
with galleons guns
looking new world
in palace sun
on shore lay montezuma
with coca leaves pearls
in halls often wandered
with secrets worlds
and subjects gathered 'round
like leaves around tree
in clothes many colours
for angry gods see
and women beautiful
and men stood straight strong
they offered life sacrifice
so others go
hate legend
and war never known
the people worked together
and lifted many stones
they carried flatlands
but died along way
and built bare hands
what still today
and i know living
and loves day
i still remember
or i lost way
he came dancing across water
cortez cortez
what killer
fade
old man lying side road
with lorries rolling
blue moon sinking weight load
and buildings scrape sky
cold wind rippling alley dawn
and morning paper fly
dead man lying side road
and daylight eyes
don't let bring
it's castles burning
find someone turning
and will come around
blind man running light night
with answer hand
come river sight
you really understand
red light flashin' window rain
can hear sirens moan
white cane lying gutter lane
and walking home alone
don't let bring
it's castles burning
find someone turning
and will come around
don't let bring
it's castles burning
find someone turning
and will come around
retune guitar d change accordingly
i think i'll go alberta
weather's good fall
i've got friends i go working
still i wish change mind
if i ask one time
but hundred times
four strong winds blow lonely
seven seas run high
all things change
come may
if good times gone
then i'm bound moving
i'll look i'm back way
if i snow flies
and things looking good
you meet i sent fare
but winter

and winds sure blow cold way
four strong winds blow lonely
seven seas run high
all things change
come may
if good times gone
then i'm bound moving
i'll look i'm back way
still i wish change mind
if i ask one time
but hundred times
four strong winds blow lonely
seven seas run high
all things change

if good times gone
then i'm bound moving
i'll look i'm back way

standing stretching every nerve

my heart going boom boom boom
grab things i've come take home
to keeping silence i resigned

today i need replacement
i'll tell smile face meant

fade
the lunatic grass
the lunatic grass
remembering games daisy chains laughs
got keep loonies path
the lunatic hall
the lunatics hall
the paper holds folded faces floor
and every day paper boy brings
and dam breaks open many years soon
and room upon hill
and head explodes dark forebodings
i'll see dark side moon
the lunatic head laughter
the lunatic head
you raise blade make change
you rearrange 'till i'm sane
you lock door
and throw away key
there's someone head
and cloud bursts thunder ear
you shout one seems hear
and band starts playing different tunes
i'll see dark side moon

breathe breathe air
don't afraid care
leave leave
look around choose ground
long live high fly
smiles give tears cry
touch see
is life will
run rabbit run
dig hole forget sun
and last work done
don't sit time dig another one
for long live high fly
but ride tide
and balanced biggest wave
you race towards early grave
hello
anybody
just nod hear
anyone home
i hear feeling
well i ease pain
feet
i need information first
just basic facts
show hurts
there pain receding
a distant ships smoke horizon
you coming waves
your lips move i hear re saying
when i child i fever
my hands felt two balloons
now i got feeling
i explain understand
this i
i become comfortably numb
i become comfortably numb
ok ok
little pinprick
there'll aaaaaahhhhh
but may feel little sick
i believe working good
that'll keep going show
come time go
there pain receding
a distant ship's smoke horizon
you coming waves
your lips move i hear saying
when i child i caught fleeting glimpse
corner eye
i turned look gone
i put finger now
the child grown dream gone
i become comfortably numb
you gotta crazy gotta real need
gotta sleep toes street
you gotta able pick easy meat eyes closed
you gotta strike moment right without thinking
and work points style
like club tie firm handshake
you trusted people lie
so turn backs
you've gotta keep one eye looking shoulder
you know gonna harder harder harder older
and end pack fly south hide head sand
just another sad old man alone dying cancer
half tempo
guitar solo ad lib
and lose control reap harvest sown
and fear grows bad blood slows turns stone
and late lose weight used need throw around
so good drown go alone
dragged stone
gotta admit i'm little bit confused
sometimes seems i'm used
gotta stay awake gotta try shake creeping malaise
if i stand ground i find way maze
deaf dumb blind keep pretending
that everyone's expendable noone real friend
and seems thing isolate winner
and everything's done sun
who born house full pain
who trained spit fan
who told man
who broken trained personnel
who fitted collar chain
who given pat back
who breaking away pack
who stranger home
who ground end
who found dead phone
who dragged stone
who dragged stone
overhead albatross
hangs motionless upon air
and deep beneath rolling waves
in labyrinths coral caves
the echo distant time
comes willowing across sand
and everything green submarine
and noone showed us land
and noone knows wheres whys
but something stirs something tries
and starts climb towards light
strangers passing street
by chance two separate glances meet
and i i see
and i take hand
and lead land
and help understand best i
and noone calls us move
and noone forces eyes
and noone speaks noone tries
and noone flies around sun
cm vamp fm
cloudless everyday fall upon waking eyes
inviting inciting rise
and window wall
come streaming sunlight wings
a million bright ambassadors morning
and noone sings lullabies
and noone makes close eyes
so i throw windows wide
and call across sky
hey cold
getting lonely getting old feel
hey standing aisles
with itchy feet fading smiles feel
hey help bury liiight
don't give without fight
hey
sitting naked phone touch
hey ear wall
waiting someone call touch
hey help carry stooone
open heart i'm coming home
but fantasy
the wall high see
no matter tried break free
and worms ate brain
hey road
always told help
hey beyond wall
breaking bottles hall help
hey tell hope aaall
together stand divided fall
money away
new car caviar four star daydream
think i'll buy football team
money back

and i think i need lear jet

i've got little black book poems
got bag toothbrush comb
when i'm good dog sometimes throw bone
i got elastic bands keeping shoes
got swollen hand blues
got thirteen channels shit tv choose
i've got electric light
and i've got second sight
and amazing powers observation
and i know
when i try
on telephone
there'll nobody home
i've got obligatory hendrix perm
and inevitable pinhole burns
all front favourite satin shirt
i've got nicotine stains fingers
i've got silver spoon chain
i've got grand piano prop mortal remains
i've got wild staring eyes
and i've got strong urge fly
but i got nowhere fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly
ooooh babe i pick phone
there's still nobody home
i've got pair gohills boots
i got fading roots


if care
happened
and i care
for
we zigzag way
through boredom pain
occasionally glancing rain
wondering buggers blame
and watching pigs wing


as i reach peach
slide line behind sofa san tropez
breaking stick brick sand
riding wave wake old sedan
sleeping alone drone darkness
scratched sand fell love
deep dreams i still hear calling
if alone i'll come home
backward homebound pigeon dove
gone wind rain airplane
born home silver spoon
i'm drinking champagne good tycoon
sooner wait break weather
i'll gather far flung thoughts together
speeding away wind new day
if alone i'll come home
and i'll pause country stile
and listen things say
digging gold hole hand
open book take look way things stand
and leading place sea
i hear soft voice calling
making date later phone
and alone i'll come home
highlight

ticking away moments make dull day
fritter waste hours offhand way
kicking around piece ground hometown
waiting someone something show way
tired lying sunshine staying home watch rain
you young life long time kill today
and one day find ten years got behind
no one told run you missed starting gun
and run run catch sun sinking
racing around come behind
the sun relative way older
shorter breath one day closer death
every year getting shorter never seem find time
plans either come naught half page scribbled lines
hanging quiet desperation english way
the time gone song thought i'd something say
home home
i i
when i come home cold tired
it's good warm bones beside fire
far away across field
tolling iron bell
calls faithful knees
to hear softly spoken magic spell
us
and ordinary men
me
god knows choose
forward cried rear
front rank died
the general sat lines map
moved side side
black blue
and knows
up
and end round round round
"haven't heard it's battle words"
poster bearer cried
"listen son" said man gun
"there's room inside"
down
it helped lot
with without
and who'll deny fighting's
out way busy day
i've got things mind
for want price tea slice
the old man died
welcome son
welcome machine
where
it's right know
you've pipe line filling time
provided toys scouting boys
you bought guitar punish ma
you school
and know nobody's fool
so welcome machine
welcome son
welcome machine
what dream
it's right told dream
you dreamed big star
he played mean guitar
he always ate steak bar
he loved drive jaguar
so welcome machine
cut

through us given life one
but lovely made love

i see us park
strolling summer days imaginings head
and words hearts
told wind felt even without said
i want bore trouble
but somethin' 'bout love
that makes weak knocks feet
there's somethin' 'bout love
that makes weak knocks feet
knocks feet
i want bore
oh i love i love i love

oh i love i love i love
we lay beneath stars
under lovers tree seen eyes mind
i reach part
of lives two hearts find
i want bore trouble
but somethin' 'bout love
that makes weak knocks feet
there's somethin' 'bout love
that makes weak knocks feet
knocks feet
i want bore
oh i love i love i love
i want bore
oh i love i love i love




music world within
with language understand
with equal opportunity
for sing dance clap hands
but record groove
don't make groove
but tell right away letter a
when people start move
they feel feel people
they feel feel people




music knows always will
be one things life quit
but music's pioneers
that time will allow us forget
for basie miller satchmo
and king sir duke
and voice ella's ringing
there's way band lose
you feel feel people
you feel feel people
you feel feel people
you feel feel people




you feel feel people

you feel feel people
you feel i feel now people
they feel come feel people
you feel everybody people

when believe things
that understand suffer

very superstitious wash face hands
when believe things
that understand suffer

very superstitious nothin' say
when believe things
that understand suffer
superstition ain't way
